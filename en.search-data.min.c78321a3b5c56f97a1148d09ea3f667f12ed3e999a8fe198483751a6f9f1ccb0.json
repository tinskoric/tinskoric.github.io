These transgressions can vary in scope but are broadly categorized by Thompson as being either sexual, financial-political, or power scandals. Each categorization represents an ideal type and is neither exhaustive nor exclusive. Each too shares in a set of factors conditioning why and by how much a scandal is damaging to a public figure, with the principal factors‚Äîparticularly visible in sexual scandals‚Äîbeing a sense of hypocrisy, conflicts of interest, and second-order transgressions. All of these can be understood as originating as disequilibria under their respective contexts. The sense of hypocrisy being between how political figures present themselves publicly‚Äîmoral individuals deserving of public support‚Äîand how they act privately. Conflicts of interest being between the trusted authorities granted by the public unto a political figure‚Äîthe capacity to publicly interfere in private affairs‚Äîand their private aims. And second-order transgressions simply repeat the cycle, adding another layer of hypocrisy or conflicts of interest (e.g., if an individual commits x transgression and attempts to cover x up via y second-order transgression, both independently can involve some or more factors). What is so fascinating about Trump is that much of this does not feel applicable to him.\nThe Teflon Don\rOriginating as the nickname of Gambino crime family boss John Gotti, ‚ÄúTeflon Don‚Äù embodies one of the defining characteristics of Trump‚Äôs public-facing persona: nothing sticks. It is a striking thing and was jokingly pointed out already during the campaign. Unlike for Gotti, the name for Trump has not strictly been associated with an ability to evade criminal prosecution but instead with his talent for avoiding electoral or political consequences for his behavior. To illustrate this, consider one historical case of scandal.\nIn the early 1960s, John Profumo, a British member of parliament, engaged in a several-month-long affair with model Christine Keeler (Thompson). When rumors of the affair swirled, Profumo soundly denied it, lying directly to the House of Commons under the afforded assumption of truthful conduct within the House. As pressure mounted, Profumo eventually conceded that he had engaged in an affair, admitted to lying, and resigned from his post. In this story, there are two transgressions. The first transgression was the affair itself and the second‚Äîor the second-order transgression‚Äîwas the denial of the affair. These transgressions ended Profumo‚Äôs political career. Trump, by contrast, has been accused by over two dozen women of sexual misconduct (Rupar) and has had two affairs become known while facing minimal consequences to his political success (Prokop). To be fair, Profumo‚Äôs affair happened during his time in office whereas even Trump‚Äôs most headline-grabbing case‚Äîthat with adult film star Stormy Daniels‚Äîhappened prior, but that says nothing of the second-order transgressions committed by both in office to cover up their affairs. Still, looking at polling data (Roper Center) aggregated by week, the percentage that approved of the former president did not see a significant drop from the week immediately before the second week of 2018‚Äîthe scandal was reported by The Wall Street Journal on Friday, January 12th, 2018‚Äîto the week immediately after, and it is safe to safe that Trump did not have to resign over the affair. Approval even rose by the third week.\nLike his proclivity to rack up sexual misconduct allegations, Trump too has often been accused of self-enrichment (Voorhees), with a sizable number of cases having occurred during his time in office. Whether it was cash-for-access schemes at his resort or promoting his wife‚Äôs jewelry line on official government websites (National Archives), much of what Donald Trump and company did during his presidency can be summarized succinctly this way. These are not scandals‚Äîjust as Trump‚Äôs affair was not a scandal simply by its occurrence‚Äîthey are examples of corruption, but their revelation would constitute a scandal under Thompson‚Äôs definition. These instances were revealed, but their consequences remain elusive. Trump even paid through stays at his hotels with taxpayer money (Voorhees), yet‚Äîlooking again at the data (Roper Center) by week‚Äîthe revelation of this in 2017 did not hurt his approval. The ‚ÄúTeflon Don‚Äù used taxpayer money at his own hotel and life went on. Why have these cases, which fit Thompson‚Äôs definition, seemingly not impacted Trump?\nComparing Numbers\rTrump was never as popular as his predecessor. Former President Barack Obama (Obama hereafter) began his first term with an approval rating of a little under 65% (Roper Center). Trump began at just over 40%. Yet by the end of each of their first years, the former would have dropped by over 10% at the polls and the latter by‚Äîcomparatively‚Äîonly a few percentage points. There are too some similarities in the trends in approval for the two former presidents‚Äîpossibly reflecting the increased polarization in national politics‚Äîwhich makes them worthwhile to compare. Trump‚Äôs popularity can be characterized as having had a low ceiling but a high floor, with the lowest and highest points of approval being closer together for him than for Obama. This seems representative of a smaller, but more staunchly supportive base.\nIn their paper Teflon Trump? Shifting Public Perceptions of Donald Trump‚Äôs Personality Traits across Four Studies over 18 Months, authors Nai and Maier write, ‚ÄúIn polarized environments, voters are likely to perceive all political issues exclusively through the lens of their partisan preferences.‚Äù In Trump‚Äôs case too he was provocative well before becoming president which could have divined out supporters prior to his being elected. This is the same man who called Rosie O‚ÄôDonnell a pig on the debate stage (Zaru) after all. Much of the paper from Nai and Maier discusses how individuals view the personalities and character of political officials and one point that is particularly salient again refers to polarization, writing that ‚Äú[‚Ä¶] the moderate but substantive negative opinion shifts [‚Ä¶] could be found in a much more dramatic way in countries where leaders have not such an extreme personality in the first place and voters are less obfuscated by hyperpartisanship.‚Äù Perhaps there is a tolerance afforded to a candidate by their support base that is higher in more polarized environments, and that tolerance is stressed only in particularly intolerable cases. Looking again at polling data (Roper Center) following his first year in office, Trump‚Äôs lowest polling performance tends to coincide with periods of national turbulence. January 2019 saw a sharp decline for one month which matches the duration of the longest government shutdown in American history (Zaveri, Gates, and Zraick). Trump‚Äôs base may accept his antics when bureaucracy functions but lose patience when that stops being the case. Working under these assumptions, the defining Trump-era scandal, something to stick, would therefore be one where the latter condition was met. It is not enough for Trump to have done something corrupt or hypocritical or in some way contrary to the moral or social standards and for that to be revealed. Whatever was done must also be of such severity that people who were otherwise‚Äîfor whatever reason‚Äîindifferent to or supportive of Trump‚Äôs behavior change their tune. Consider late-2019.\nWhat will stick?\rUkraine has long been in a precarious position. Even before the invasion by the Russian Federation (Russia hereafter), the nation was stuck in an awkward limbo between liberal democratic elements and corruptive influence. Ukraine and Russia have some broad similarities concerning the oligarchic control schemes present in both, but in the former, there has been greater success on the part of the populace in combatting it. Following the Maidan Revolution, which had ousted then-Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, and the Russian annexation of Crimea and separatist rebellions in the Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts, the United States worked to realign Ukraine more firmly its side. Part of this came in the form of aid, intended to bolster the strength of the Ukrainian military against the increasing Russian threat. In September 2019, the public came to learn that Trump had halted the flow of aid (Wolf and Merrill) to solicit political favors from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky (Zelensky hereafter). Trump had pressured Zelensky to investigate Hunter Biden, son of then-Vice President and now current President Joseph R. Biden. Hunter Biden had been put on the board of Ukrainian energy company Burisma (Wolf and Merrill), and Trump intended to use this to demonstrate the presence of nepotism and corruption for financial gain on the part of the Bidens. Regardless of the case‚Äîthough I will note that the Bidens were cleared‚Äîwhat Trump did in his attempts to show the apparent criminality of the Biden family was a crime and was enough to warrant impeachment proceedings. This measurably hurt Trump‚Äôs approval (Roper Center), and although he did recover, the shape of the scandal made it more impactful. It was not just Trump saying something insulting or crude, it was him abusing his position as president to extract personal favors and managing to embarrass the United States on the world stage in doing so.\nWhile Trump managed to weather that scandal too, the decrease in approval was more sustained and was, if anything, softened only because of exogenous factors like CoVid-19. It may be difficult to recognize if charted out like in the first visualization, but one needs to recognize that following the government shutdown and before January 6th, the two lowest periods of Trump‚Äôs approval were nationwide protests sparked by the murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police and the Ukraine quid pro quo scandal (Roper Center). In that same span of two years, Trump had a litany of other scandals come up, but none hurt him so. With this new theoretical framework in mind‚Äîunderstanding that it is tumult and embarrassment that can chip at the Teflon Don‚Äîmaybe something even larger will have a lasting impact on approval.\nThe Big One\rIf the quid pro quo with Ukraine was damaging, January 6th was a catastrophic send-off to an unpopular lame-duck president. Following the November 2020 elections, Trump repeatedly attempted to combat the results, cry foul, and claim victory (U.S. House Select Committee To Investigate The January 6th Attack On The United States Capitol). This behavior did not result in a noticeable drop in monthly approval (Roper Center), which is consistent with the adjusted framework requiring that element of national or international turbulence. Trump‚Äôs approval had even post-election risen to a relative high following the protests earlier in the summer. While contesting an election is a heated process, throughout this period, Trump had publicly been doing so through the legal channels (Woodward and Costa), which made it palatable and ignorable for most. If there is anything to hammer home about Trump‚Äôs scandals and approval, it is that if something is generally possible to ignore, many who are politically aligned with Trump‚Äîpolarized American right-wing voters‚Äîwill ignore it. Trump‚Äôs attempts to contest the election would become increasingly difficult to ignore throughout December 2020, already resulting in that small drop, culminating in all the nefariousness of January 2021. In this last month, Trump was resorting to hoping that his Vice President Mike Pence would refuse to certify the election (U.S. House Select Committee To Investigate The January 6th Attack On The United States Capitol) and that that would somehow be a thing that a vice president could simply do. The same day this was supposed to happen, as Trump was publicly desperate to overturn the election, the Capitol riots began. Not a great look for Trump, even if it did not matter much at that point electorally for him. January 6th was an embarrassment for the United States and included live televised feeds of utter chaos at the seat of the government. Foreign officials, not just his counterpart in the Chinese Peoples‚Äô Liberation Army but other world leaders, were calling General Mark Milley to ask if the United States was still stable ``(U.S. House Select Committee To Investigate The January 6th Attack On The United States Capitol). January 6th should have resulted in approval falling off a cliff. While this is a somewhat crude method of understanding the effects of January 6th on Trump‚Äôs approval, and should not be taken as gospel, if we map a local regression onto the data for the 48 months preceding the month of January 2021, we can guess from that what approval during that last month could have been had there not been any significant changes. Here is what we get:\nAgain, this is very crude, it is literally a moving average but it is a simple way to get across a big point. Without going into too much depth, as with the other scandals discussed, it is completely possible to use Thompson‚Äôs framework of scandal, conditioned by the level of tumult and embarrassment‚Äîthe lack of ‚Äúignorability‚Äù‚Äîto understand how impactful this was, and this may be useful as we reflect on the many Trump-like world leaders that have come and gone with him.\nReferences\r1.

First slowly, then suddenly. The small town‚Äîthe rural city‚Äîis a pocket‚Äîa vestige of what could have been looking out from some time immemorial when suburbia had not yet come to dominate. While the image of rural America‚Äîbutchered by popular depictions‚Äîmay tell of places hardly able to provide much of anything to their citizenry, the rural city is different. The rural city can provide, for now. But what after? There is little to do. A space of some thousands in number, educated relatively well, surrounded by dead industry and minimum wage service jobs. Sure, there are most opportunities available than in the truly empty spaces, but why stay for something so‚ÄîI feel very sorry to put it like this‚Äîmiddling? The tragedy of these places is that they manage to provide more than they are worth‚Äîcomparatively speaking‚Äîand present little reason to do anything but leave. ‚Äú[‚Ä¶] Small towns are especially good at recognizing, nurturing, and launching talented individuals. They rally to prepare achievers to leave, succeed brilliantly in doing so, then lament the loss of their combined talents‚Äù (Carr \u0026amp; Kefalas, p. 51). I do not want to dwell too long on this note, but keep it in mind as I talk about some interesting aspects of American rural education.\nEducational Attainment\rThe trope of the uneducated or undereducated rural is a gross exaggeration, and it washes over the variety of conditions which exist concerning education in rural America. When looking at primary and secondary education levels, the discrepancy is not exactly enormous. Particularly in the case of the former, ‚Äú[rural children] perform as well as urban children on standardized tests‚Äù (Clark, et al.). While standardized testing is a whole assortment of problems on its own, the fact the performance is generally consistent between rural and urban communities lends credence to the idea that the education gap below the post-secondary collegiate level is overblown. Where a clear discrepancy does exist though, is when it comes to higher levels of educational attainment. In terms of collegiate educational attainment ‚Äú[rural students are behind] suburban and urban counterparts [‚Ä¶] largely because of their lower socioeconomic background‚Äù (Byun, et al.). What is curious though, is that rural areas across the country tend to underperform the trend more at higher levels of income (see the figure below). The more potentially well-off, the worse the performance relatively.\nThis can be explained as rural counties simply making up a greater proportion of lower median income counties, but even with that in mind, urban counties at lower income levels do not tend to perform nearly as often and far above the trendline as they do at higher levels of income. The disparity between rural and urban educational achievement grows with greater levels of income. In this case, rurality is a greater determinant of attainment than income, but that is because the positive impact of rising incomes on education is conditioned by the negative impact of rurality. What could that negative impact be?\nRural Income Inequality\rIt is not just that rural America is poor, it is that ‚Äú[‚Ä¶] high levels of local income inequality have been a disproportionally rural issue over the past half-century‚Äù (Butler, et al.). There are actually many places in the United States that are both very rural and very affluent but living in them as a less-than-affluent individual is a quick ticket to a harsh life. Less dense regions have a lesser availability of public resources to aid individuals who need help and that means that as you start climbing the ladder of costs‚Äîgoing to college is slightly more expensive than the 3rd grade‚Äîthose unable to bridge the gap will not. This is not the only factor, of course, and that is visible in the fact that at the state-level, sometimes the rural-urban divide on educational attainment is not so significant. For example, according to data from the U.S. Census and the American Community Survey (ACS), the divide in the state of Texas is significantly less pronounced than that in the states of Alabama, Kansas, or West Virginia. Still, we see at the national level that there is a correlation between median income and educational attainment, and we see that rural counties underperform relative to urban ones as median income levels rise.\nA Tangent About Rural Out-migration\rRecall the small town. What, thinking between income and post-secondary collegiate education, primarily influences out-migration from rural areas? Looking again at county-level data from the U.S. Census and ACS, in the states of Vermont and West Virginia, the rural counties that did not experience population decline between 2010 and 2020 tended to be wealthier. In West Virginia for example, Pleasants County with one of the lowest number of residents, 25 years or older, recorded as holding a bachelor‚Äôs degree or higher at 11.9%, was one of only 6 counties‚Äî4 rural counties‚Äîthat did not experience decline from 2010 to 2020. The counties not experiencing out-migration were, in all, less relatively poor than they were relatively or strictly uneducated. Income is a greater determinant than educational attainment in cases of migration when the two are examined purely side-by-side. The counties that did not experience population decline tended to be wealthier, even when they were not always particularly well educated compared to the rest of the state. Do people leave because they are educated or because they can make more money? There is a difference.\nReturning to Income\rIf the goal is strictly to improve collegiate educational attainment on the whole among rural American counties, it is easier to just say ‚Äúgive people money,‚Äù in light of how complex accounting for rurality becomes. I wholeheartedly support that measure as a currently poor college student (as of 2023, fingers crossed I win the lottery), but unfortunately it does not play well politically. Incomes would have to be raised endogenously, but how? Remember the small towns, people leave the moment they think they have the tools to make it somewhere better. Moreover due to regional variation, it is clear that some places will not even see much change in outcome from higher levels of income. What is more actionable? What could prepare people for jobs that are available even in rural spaces (not counting remote work but that is valuable to consider) such that they will not just leave, and what could do so for less than what is charged by universities today?\nOne Idea\rTrade work is many things, but to avoid going into excruciating detail, think welders, electricians, mechanics, and all jobs of that nature. Trade work can be learned at trade schools. Trade schools tend to not only be cheaper than a baccalaureate education, but can provide an education that is‚Äîdepending on the subject of study‚Äîapplicable in almost any place, serving as a reliable ticket to employment even in rural counties. Additionally, vocational education can serve as an outlet for students who tend to underperform individually in classroom environments (Rich). This is skilled work that pays well, or at least better than a lot of work available in rural areas. This is also work that requires an education and ‚Äú[requires] workers who can interpret blueprints, program computerized machinery and solve problems on the fly‚Äù (Rich). Despite this, the federal government has not pinned nearly as much value as should be onto these institutions as possible centers of rural education in the past few years (Rich), allowing trade schools to fall out of the immediate mind even among some who live in the areas which could most benefit.\nTrade schools are cheaper to attend and can provide an education that is more than applicable to the job market in rural counties. The point is not to prevent people from pursuing an academic career, it is to promote an alternative that could convince them to stay closer to home by giving them a way to actually make money there. Additionally, opening up vocational opportunities could get older residents in rural counties back to school, which would improve general education in counties. ‚ÄúIn the future, most young adults will need post-secondary education in order to find good-paying jobs. However, millions of so-called ‚Äòmiddle skill jobs‚Äô will require something less than a bachelor‚Äôs degree‚Äù (Harvard Graduate School of Education). Again, this is an alternative that makes sense in the context of wanting to raise incomes and keep populations within rural communities as it will achieve one by the other and vice versa. These institutions have their own problems, and I will at some point expand on them, but for now I will close by saying that I think they are valuable to improving both incomes in rural areas and reducing out-migration. Perhaps, as incomes rise, more will later go on to pursue a baccalaureate education and hopefully, there will be more opportunities to use that degree at home in future.\nReferences\r1.

That of the sugary drink guzzling, Big Mac obliterating, personification of health complications working some kind of manual job in some kind of dying industry. The thing is that it does not come from nowhere, many people eat and live lives just like that, but what is one to do when their closest affordable meal for miles, painfully, is from a fast-food chain? While many of the issues plaguing the socioeconomic fabric\nof America come from a history of vile hatred and abuse‚Äîone example being the existence of urban food deserts‚Äîthe existence of rural food deserts feels more like a form of tragic neglect. To look at what I mean, I want to talk about business and infrastructure, but first, a little background.\nWhen Capital Starves\rRural American food deserts form from a confluence of things, but according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the defining element of one is being simultaneously low-income and low access. Low-income and low-access areas are then defined as places maintaining either ‚Äúa poverty rate of 20 percent or greater, or a median family income at or below 80 percent of the statewide or metropolitan area median family income‚Äù (USDA), and as places wherein ‚Äúat least 500 and/or at least 33 percent of the population lives more than 10 [Rural Cases] miles from a supermarket or large grocery store‚Äù (USDA). To oversimplify, if one is too poor, too far, or some mix of both to reliably access store-bought foodstuffs then for that person it is as if those things do not exist at all. Imagine yourself in such a situation, ignoring all the other tragedies of rural poverty which would befall you. Imagine that a gas station or convenience store is your only option. Imagine that they charge more than you can afford because they are the only game in town, and it is a logistical nightmare to get good food out where you are. Further, because of how limited the options for healthy food are, childhood obesity‚Äîa growing concern across the United States‚Äîis particularly pronounced in these areas, not for want of parents‚Äô efforts (Yousefian A, Leighton A, Fox K, Hartley D). It was not always like this. Many rural communities struggling today were at some point thriving, but as pointed out over a decade ago in a PBS News Hour broadcast, when jobs dry up, so does everything else. ‚ÄúWe even had dry goods stores. We had a grocery storm. We had a pharmacy. We had all of that, a doctor‚Äôs office. But now it‚Äôs nothing here‚Äù (PBS).\nWhere Capital Starves\rEarlier I mentioned the high costs incurred by simply buying goods in food deserts, due in part to the logistics behind getting goods to them. That problem stems from a general lack of infrastructure designed to facilitate such a process in the first place. Of course, grocery stores and supermarkets themselves are forms of infrastructure, but neither can exist without a means of getting goods to them. Let us look at the state of Vermont. According to the visualization shown at the top of this page, Essex County is the poorest in the state of Vermont. Essex County also has within its boundaries many of the food deserts identified in the state (USDA). What makes these points important to my highlighting of logistics is that Essex County, on top of everything else, has some of the worst road connectivity in the state. To illustrate this, I want to consider the town of Brighton, one of the largest in the county. For food to get to store shelves in town, it may have to travel out from Boston or any number of large distribution center cities over to U.S. Route 91, and from there on to Vermont Route 114, a two-lane road (UVM). Consider the possibility of a bottleneck with a semi-truck going down that road to serve just around one thousand people, because that is one of the only major roads through Vermont that gets there. The only other option would be to drive up through New Hampshire and cut through Vermont Route 105, another two-lane road. Expecting ungodly-massive highways to connect a state of under one million is an unreasonable ask, and would frankly be a terrible waste of nature, but there is a real and noticeable disparity in the availability of rail or road infrastructure in Essex County compared to the rest of the state. The county I live in, Rutland County, has 14 state routes and 2 U.S. Routes travelling through it (VCGI). In comparison, Essex County has 3 and 1 respectively (VCGI). The only other county with as few major roads going through it as is Grand Isle County (VCGI), a chain of islands in Lake Champlain constituting about one-eighth the land. To be fair, Grand Isle County is more populous than its major roadway count counterpart but still‚Äîit is in the middle of a lake. Poor road connectivity lengthens trips, which may otherwise take less time, and when living in a place with few options for healthy food nearby, that matters a great deal.\nWhy Capital Starves\rThe state of infrastructure in Essex County could be chalked up to the minuscule share of the state population residing there, and the lower median incomes of those who do (USDA). Surely the state coffers must be a little light, and so few live there anyway, if there was anywhere that would be comparatively worse off it would make sense that it was there. However, this perspective ignores two key elements. First, that in 1890 the population of Essex County was once almost double what it is now (USCB). In fact, the population of the county at that time, though still lower than many other counties, was nearly three times that of that same group of islands in Lake Champlain which today outshine it (USCB). Second, that that should not matter at all. When talking about something like the rationality behind why a place is under-served by business or state infrastructure, we are ignoring that human beings with lives live there. That is the key tragedy in the neglect which many smaller rural communities face and which leads them to shrink, convulse, and collapse. Is it fair to blame businesses, particularly smaller businesses which lack the leeway granted by proceeds from other locations? Sort of, but not really. Why would someone go through the work of setting up a storefront, dealing with distributors, and getting the word out, if they cannot even find anyone to work (Alexander Marre) because of how rapidly people are leaving? This is generally an issue many rural areas face but it must be particularly hard among food deserts where people are even poorer and often even less in number.\nHow Capital Starves\rIn the same way that the universe is not necessarily cruel for each misfortune which we face, the worsening of conditions among small rural communities is not intentionally cruel. It is rational according to the economic order we have set. It is instead that that economic order is incompatible with rural life. Many rural communities at some point ate what they grew themselves almost exclusively, and food availability was less of a concern. Today rural communities are farming and gardening still, but sending what they collect to be processed and likely eaten somewhere else, turning around to find their own shelves empty (PBS). ‚Äù It‚Äôs really hard, because, you know, when I was coming up, we had greens and gardens and all that. But now you have to buy produce. So, it‚Äôs real hard for the kids‚Äù (PBS). Some would argue that the systems in place now are fundamentally the same as they were in the recent past but that is not true. The reach of these systems is what kills. Rural areas have long struggled with infrastructure, but that was generally fine when they were closed units, barring the odd harvest failure. When these same places no longer eat most of what they grow and when they must rely on the decrepit infrastructure for basic food, they suffer. The profit incentive leads not only to the neglect of infrastructure, but also to the wholesale ignorance of the predicament these people are in.\nCounterintuitively, businesses in rural areas tend to be more profitable than in other areas once they have gotten the chance to get running (Richmond FED, Atlanta FED), but the problem is that you need people with money, and you need people to work, and at this point a lot of the worst-hit communities have neither. Many rural areas depend on smaller banks as well (Richmond FED, Atlanta FED) and while they often do have an easier time getting financed, some areas are so small that they do not even have banks, or so poor that banks shut down (Courtney Brown) .\nTo give Vermont some quick credit though, as this is focused slightly on the state, things are not nearly as bad or exploitative in this sense as they are in some areas in the Midwest or South. Speaking about the Midwest in contrast I think the reason Vermont avoids some of the worst of this is just a different social understanding behind farming and community. The colonization of the Midwest and later West coast‚Äîtell me that is not what it was, I dare you‚Äîby the United States was a rushed affair telling people to go out and get land to find riches. The existence of many old railroad towns out in the heartland is entirely for profit. In contrast the colonization of New England was, to begin with, communities eking out sufficiency away from the British Isles or elsewhere. This is an oversimplification, absolutely, but I think it is important to point out.\nSolutions\rIf businesses don‚Äôt want to enter these communities, the solution is either to make it more appealing to do so or to return to a more closed loop. Either cut people in on the deal or let them live as they wish because the current half-measure is going to kill these places. The former option would take more work than the latter, but would ultimately be far better for everyone, the question is how to get there. There are a few ways government could act. State and federal authorities could improve infrastructure, which would provide jobs in the immediate term and reduce costs for businesses in the long term. They could also push financial incentives for businesses operating in rural areas, maybe vouchers or tax deductions. These are the two main ideas which come to mind, and they are not particularly new. This is already being done by some, but I‚Äôd argue it needs to be done more and by more states. The real issue is just getting businesses to go there and getting them over the startup hurdle.\nReferences\r1.

While wages went up (USBLS) and comparatively decent jobs remain available, half the country seems to think that we are back in 2008. Hell, unemployment is back to pre-pandemic levels (USBLS), with long-term unemployment (27 weeks or more) falling as well, and the federal funds rate, while rising steeply, just hit what it was around this same time in 2019 (FRED). It is not like nothing is going on, though, something must be off for people to be so concerned, so what is it? Prices. That is it, or a lot of it. The confluence of ongoing supply chain issues, a war in one of the most vital exporting countries in the grain market (WSJ) instigated by an important export country in the natural gas market, greed, and yes, to an extent the rapid expansion of the money supply from government assistance during the pandemic has worked out to a sharp rise in prices across the board. Is this concerning? Absolutely. Is this a recession? No.¬†So why do I keep hearing the word?\nIgnoring the Data\rIn 2020 a global pandemic threw the global economy for a loop. Industries whose work could not easily be transferred online declined and millions of people were suddenly unemployed, and no one was sure when exactly things would end. Two years later and the pandemic is still close to us. Some of those millions who were unemployed, and many others, are dead now. But one could be forgiven for mistaking that things had passed with how little care many seem to have anymore. This general sense of apathy, or at least conscious ignorance, has grown so bad in fact that there is already some whole new pandemic and I have yet to hear a single real person share much concern over it. No one wants to care about anymore, and the governments of the world‚Äîwhich had at one time thrown enormous sums of money into the void which constituted their pandemic economies‚Äîhave just as quickly dropped all mandates and shoved everyone back to the workplace. On one hand this makes sense, there is a feeling that prior to the pandemic things made some kind of sense and that organizations should return to their state of being. On the other hand, over one million people have died, just in the United States, and many are still dying, and no matter how much we choose to ignore it, things are not just going to become normal.\nBut what does any of that have to do with our present recessionary woes? A great deal, actually.\nThe trouble with selectively detaching yourself from the realities before you is that it becomes hard to keep up with everything else. While national economies are no strangers to emotion‚Äîlook no further than the intense volatility of some stocks to see how impactful feelings can be‚Äîthe degree to which many are now just going with their guts on this whole thing is almost unprecedented. The stubbornness with which we continue to ignore the presence of a deadly pandemic has made its way into how we think about a great many things. In this case then, ‚Äúrecession‚Äù has taken on a whole new meaning, realistically becoming a buzzword for ‚Äúthings are bad and I don‚Äôt like it,‚Äù or, more appropriately the current ‚Äúbad vibes.‚Äù This situation is articulated well by Felix Salmon and Elizabeth Spiers in a recent episode of the podcast Slate Money;\n[Elizabeth Spiers] ‚ÄúI think people conflate their sense of financial security with a sense of overall stability and security in general. So if there is a lot of chaos happening in the world, they will automatically sort of assume that this is affecting them economically, even though it might not be the case.‚Äù\nGranted many are hit hard by soaring prices for goods but the point stands. A lot is happening, we have gone over this, and emotional overload is both very real and very reasonable given the state of affairs in the past few years but even still what could convince people that things are so unstable? One example could be the rollback of government programs as we reenter our faux normalcy, but the fact is that many of those programs worked in service of businesses more than individual people, at least directly.\nBut the Markets!\rNowhere do we see the presence of this ‚Äúbad vibes‚Äù mentality more than in the stock market, the beating heart of volatility, and more importantly, something often conflated with economic health and well-being. As Felix Salmon says, ‚ÄúThe stock market. Your stocks are down. Used to feel wealthy because stocks were up high and rising. Now you feel poor because stocks are lower and falling.‚Äù It really is a perfect kind of storm. For many years there has been this beating of the drum to instill the idea that the market and the economy are linked, and to be fair, it is not so much that they are not as it is that that is not the whole story. But nevertheless, people look towards this mythical thing for answers and right now it is not giving particularly good ones. At the same time people are again going with their guts and so there is a combination of feeling bad and then hearing dreadful things from one of the main places you look. This is not to mention how much big words catch headlines so I cannot help but side-eye publishers and agencies for opining the end of prosperity for clicks. The market was also just performing phenomenally while millions were unemployed and starving so again, it is not really reflective of how things are doing.\nThe Near Future\rOne of the most worrying things about this whole situation though is that, at the end of everything, economic health is genuinely dependent on our deeply personal faith in how things are going. When people lose faith, as many are, that‚Äôs when things start to go wrong fast. It is a tough situation because there are significant issues right now facing us down economically‚Äîthe number of people presently unhoused is growing and rising costs certainly are not helping (Washington Post), and the minimum wage is nowhere near when it needs to be‚Äîand they are only magnified by the kind of fear that comes with words like recession. Luckily, the ‚Äúvibe‚Äù has not yet soured enough for people to stop spending, which means that things might just work out if we can get inflation under control.\nReferences\r1.

When viewing data visualizations, keep in mind the direction of data more than what individual numeric values may be. As a final note, it could be possible that the realities of those experiencing houselessness over the past decade have been entirely different from what are identified as national trends, and were just masked under family houselessness, which is sometimes difficult to track accurately, especially given the limitations of the PIT count system, which only records individuals that can be found on the street one night a year. Data can be hard. Background and Overview\rWhen speaking about experiencing houselessness in the public space we are not often asked to think of the plight faced by those with few places to go, but instead to pity the poor homeowners who must bear witness. It is not the fault of the system that those people are without houses, it is fault on their own parts for forcing everyone to have to look at them. This is dehumanizing. Even less often though, are we asked to look at the racial disparities in communities experiencing houselessness that we dehumanize. The population experiencing houselessness in the United States is nearly 40% percent Black, triple the respective size of the Black community in America at large. This naturally leads to a simple question, why is the rate of people experiencing houselessness among Black Americans so high relative to the nation at large? Moreover, how could houselessness overall be combatted and why have such policies not been put in place? The next series of sections will explore these questions, first, by identifying potential factors behind houselessness, and then seeing if those factors are more prevalent or extreme among Black Americans than the national average, along with a look at why that may be the case through a historical lens. Finally, the last sections will discuss policy changes along with notes on how the public perception of those experiencing houselessness through portrayals in media has prevented those policy measures from being implemented. All data will be included at the end in the references section.\nVisualization Data Sources:\nHomelessness in America (GitHub)1,\rFHFA2,\rOECD3,\rCensus Bureau4,\rSt.¬†Louis Fed5\nDefining Houselessness\rMost people have a very bare understanding of the concept of experiencing houselessness, mainly the part about not having a house, but defining houselessness on a policy level is a bit more layered. What constitutes a home may be vastly different to different people, so when trying to be objective with data, it is important to draw a line in the sand. Much of the data looked at in this paper will be either directly or indirectly sourced from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD hereinafter), so it follows to use the definition6 that they work with. According to the HUD, there are four categories under which a person or persons could be considered as experiencing houselessness, and these four are the ones that will reflect what houselessness means throughout this paper. The definition categories are as follows:\nIndividuals who lack a fixed, regular, and adequate nighttime residence. This includes people who may reside or have resided in emergency shelters.\nIndividuals and families who are in imminent danger of losing their primary nighttime residence.\nUnaccompanied youth and families with children and youth who are defined as homeless under other federal statutes who do not otherwise qualify as homeless under this definition.\nIndividuals and families who are fleeing, or are trying to flee, domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, stalking, or other dangerous or life-threatening conditions that relate to violence against the individual or a family member.\nElements contributing to houselessness tend to revolve around interruptions in the ability of a person or series of persons to carry out necessary activities to maintain their housing status. These include, but are by no means limited to, unemployment, domestic violence, substance abuse, incarceration, housing costs (lack of affordable housing), and changes in income level.7\nIdentifying Trends in Houselessness\rAccording to annual reports8 issued by the HUD to congress, the number of Americans who may be experiencing houselessness on any given night has been seen to have had a steady decline over the past decade with the reported Point-in-Time (PIT hereinafter) number as of January 2007 being 671,888, a decrease of approximately 6 percent compared against what was reported the previous year. Following the Great Recession, the rate of persons experiencing houselessness continued to decrease despite the rise in foreclosures as the housing bubble burst. The reported PIT number as of January 2009 was 643,067, the same time when housing prices were still dropping. Even by the beginning of 2012 when median housing prices had hit a new relatively low, the PIT number as of January was 633,782, although notably an increase from the previous year still overall saw a continuation of the decrease which had been taking place. This is important to find, not because of the actual change in housing prices, but because of what was resulting during this period. Established and time-tested financial institutions were collapsing under the weight of mass-defaults on mortgages, and the national economy was being put to the fire. During the midst of one of the worst recessions in American history, the number of recorded Americans experiencing houselessness was still generally on the downturn. This removes the notion of houselessness being strictly tied to market conditions, and this will be shown further when seen over a broader period. Maybe in the absence of necessary services the recession would have played a far greater role in pushing households off the deep end but that would only be evidence that houselessness would be a result of poor policy over economic realities.\nWhat can be seen most clearly when comparing trends in yearly housing pricing against trends in PIT numbers and unemployment is that even during periods where the housing market was recovering, PIT counts continued decreasing. Houselessness is a crisis of affordability, of being unable to meet growing costs, not simply of the costs themselves. People may have a variety of reasons for not being able to get something, why else would there be multiple categories by which houselessness is defined, but that reason is often just money. That difference can be shown by the change in unemployment rates as the national economy recovered. While the relationship between the two is not exact, PIT counts still decreased as unemployment rose, decreases in unemployment do appear to have been associated with greater reductions in PIT counts, even as housing prices rebounded. Comparing national income rates with PIT counts shows a similar trend to unemployment.\nElements like national income are associated with reductions in pit counts in some way, what is also clear from data collected and the data on display here is that the conversation on houselessness, while being a national one, is very probably heavily dependent on conditioned elements. There is in both cases, national unemployment and income, a reduction in houselessness overall regardless of the direction of either element. If these elements then, while being some of the most important determinants of houselessness, are not able to be identified as absolutely impactful, then the question becomes one of if these elements are more impactful when under certain conditions. If they can be identified as such, and in conjunction with other elements, like differences among states or regions, then this could be understood as government failing to meet the needs of its citizens with policy. This is all to say that there is, in fact, an important condition to consider here, race. Nearly 40% of persons experiencing houselessness are Black, and that jumps to over 50% of families.9\nA History of Oppression and Housing Discrimination\rThere are two primary elements to find. First, the extent to which centuries of oppressive and racist policies continue to affect modern communities in preventing the building of wealth, and second, the extent to which housing discrimination in particular has been involved. It should be of no surprise that enslavement prevented economic progress for Black Americans, what should however be an infinite source of shame for the nation is that this gap in progress has not been rectified, in fact, it has broadened as the effects of sweeping measures linger. Black Americans have been deprived of land, of labor, capital, and at many points of the tools to do anything about it. Jim Crow policies pushed children into schools that were underfunded and unprepared to even pretend to be supplying education at equal standards, and amazingly, even as outright segregation was outlawed, school districts across the country, particularly in areas like New York City, remain deeply segregated.10 At just this point a line could be drawn. It cannot be expected of an entire community of people to work from an uneven starting point and somehow reach the same endpoint in the same period. Yet things continue. Policies of unjust mass incarceration have separated Black American families, causing untold harm to children by completely removing parental figures in influential years, and leaving the parent that remains, if one remains, to simultaneously care for the child and work as a single parent.11 And these rates of incarceration are unjust, greatly fueled by minor drug offenses for which Black Americans have been historically targeted12, particularly in cases of marijuana, heroin, and crack cocaine, which was treated with much greater severity even for distribution than cocaine was, even though crack was just a far cheaper offshoot of cocaine.13 Even in where Black Americans live there have been policies that worked to their direct detriment. Housing discrimination. Entire towns wrote into their charters that only White residents would be permitted14 and in areas with sizable Black communities, policies like redlining across American cities made sure to absolute drive neighborhoods with a strong Black American presence into the ground by listing those areas as hazardous and starving them of investment and support in the form of federally insured loans from the government.15 On average, Black communities are poorer16, see underfunded education, and are more likely to see their members incarcerated, and all of these elements can be traced to policies still within the realm of recent history.17\nRedlined map of Atlanta, GA\nHouselessness is an issue of government failing to meet the needs of its citizens with policy, and the government has hardly ever pretended to meet the needs of its Black citizens.\nReanalysis of Trends\rUnemployment and income levels have been shown to have an impact on houselessness, and given the evidence supplied behind why Black communities often face greater levels of houselessness it is worth looking at by how much unemployment and income levels differ for Black Americans compared to the whole. With a solid difference found both aspects would be confirmed.\nThere is clear evidence of both disparities in employment and income, this furthers that historic and present policy decisions have continued to push Black Americans towards an economic position that is worse situated than that of White Americans, or, at least, have not acted to mend the rift.\nPolicy Initiatives\rOn the national level, individuals and families across the board are being pushed closer to the edge as costs of living outpace income, but as was said earlier, this is a crisis of affordability, and while rising costs of living are difficult enough to bear as is18, Black American communities find themselves doubly-assaulted by the simple fact that while costs go up everywhere, they still have less money to meet those costs. Solutions to such an issue can range from raising the minimum wage for all Americans, subsidizing housing and rental costs for persons and families at risk of becoming houseless19, and plainly giving people homes.20More targeted solutions specifically for Black Americans could revolve around investing in infrastructure and businesses in historically Black communities and criminal justice reform aimed at preventing the destruction of families and the limiting of cash bail.\nPopular Media and Public Perception\rWhat holds back rational policy initiatives is poor public perception of persons experiencing houselessness, which has been compounded by portrayals in media. Those experiencing houselessness are presented as failures in a difficult world, a sad story to be sure, but not one to be aided. It is their fault for allowing themselves to become houseless. To give credit to national media and those who hold this perception, any other more correct portrayal would actually need a level of introspection that most do not want to endure. The reality is that most American citizens are far closer to experiencing houselessness than they would like to imagine, and it is easier to just blame individuals for failing than to blame a system not supplying support to people in need.21\nConcluding Points and the Future\rHouselessness will continue throughout the United States for however long earnest steps are not taken to combat the problems behind it. PIT counts of houselessness have increased in the years since those in the visualizations presented. Only time will tell how much damage the COVID-19 pandemic has done. Moreover, the unequal distribution of who is experiencing houselessness will almost certainly persist in conjunction with houselessness overall as there appears to have been no real alteration of policies which keep the environment in which such inequalities may be fostered. Things are not all doom and gloom though, there are still fewer people experiencing houselessness than there were even prior to the Great Recession. How these trends continue relies on us.\nHomelessness in America (GitHub)‚Ü©Ô∏é\nMaster HPI Data (FHFA)‚Ü©Ô∏é\nNet National Income Indicator (OECD)‚Ü©Ô∏é\nBlack Income (Census Bureau)‚Ü©Ô∏é\nBlack Unemployment (FRED)‚Ü©Ô∏é\nHomeless Emergency Assistance and Rapid Transition to Housing: Defining ‚ÄúHomeless‚Äù (U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development)‚Ü©Ô∏é\nFactors contributing to Homelessness (Homeless Resource Network)‚Ü©Ô∏é\n2007, 2009, and 2012 Annual Homeless Assessment Report to Congress, July 2008, June 2010, and December 2012 (U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development)‚Ü©Ô∏é\nHomelessness and Racial Disparities, October 2020 (National Alliance to End Homelessness)‚Ü©Ô∏é\nStill Separate, Still Unequal: Teaching about School Segregation and Educational Inequality, May 2019 (New York Times)‚Ü©Ô∏é\nBroken Hearts and Broken Homes: How Mass Incarceration Impacts Children and Families (May), May 2019 (Duke University)‚Ü©Ô∏é\nNixon‚Äôs Drug War, An Excuse To Lock Up Blacks And Protesters, Continues, March 2016 (Forbers)‚Ü©Ô∏é\nHow Crack Cocaine Destroyed Black Communities in the United States, May 2020 (The African Exponent)‚Ü©Ô∏é\nThe Case for Reparations, June 2014 (The Atlantic)‚Ü©Ô∏é\nThe Roots of Redlining: Academic, Governmental, and Professional Networks in the Making of the New Deal Lending Regime, June 2021 (Oxford Academic, The Journal of American History)‚Ü©Ô∏é\nInequalities Persist Despite Decline in Poverty For All Major Race and Hispanic Origin Groups, September 2020 (Census Bureau)‚Ü©Ô∏é\nRedlining: The Origin Story of Institutional Racism, April 2019 (The Root)‚Ü©Ô∏é\nAmerica‚Äôs Rental Housing: Evolving Markets and Needs, 2013 (Joint Center for Housing Studies of Harvard University)‚Ü©Ô∏é\nThe Post-Recession Homelessness Epidemic, July 2014 (Next City)‚Ü©Ô∏é\nSolutions, 2021 (National Alliance to End Homelessness)‚Ü©Ô∏é\nHomeless and Hopeless: Resignation in News Media Constructions of Homelessness as a Social Problem Constructions of Homelessness as a Social Problem, 1992 (University of Pennsylvania)‚Ü©Ô∏é\n"},{"id":9,"href":"/about/","title":"About","section":"üè†","content":"\rAbout\rIt‚Äôs only fair to give a little background on who I am and don‚Äôt worry, I‚Äôll be brief.
