That of the sugary drink guzzling, Big Mac obliterating, personification of health complications working some kind of manual job in some kind of dying industry. The thing is that it does not come from nowhere, many people eat and live lives just like that, but what is one to do when their closest affordable meal for miles, painfully, is from a fast-food chain? While many of the issues plaguing the socioeconomic fabric\nof America come from a history of vile hatred and abuse—one example being the existence of urban food deserts—the existence of rural food deserts feels more like a form of tragic neglect. To look at what I mean, I want to talk about business and infrastructure, but first, a little background.\nWhen Capital Starves\rRural American food deserts form from a confluence of things, but according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the defining element of one is being simultaneously low-income and low access. Low-income and low-access areas are then defined as places maintaining either “a poverty rate of 20 percent or greater, or a median family income at or below 80 percent of the statewide or metropolitan area median family income” (USDA), and as places wherein “at least 500 and/or at least 33 percent of the population lives more than 10 [Rural Cases] miles from a supermarket or large grocery store” (USDA). To oversimplify, if one is too poor, too far, or some mix of both to reliably access store-bought foodstuffs then for that person it is as if those things do not exist at all. Imagine yourself in such a situation, ignoring all the other tragedies of rural poverty which would befall you. Imagine that a gas station or convenience store is your only option. Imagine that they charge more than you can afford because they are the only game in town, and it is a logistical nightmare to get good food out where you are. Further, because of how limited the options for healthy food are, childhood obesity—a growing concern across the United States—is particularly pronounced in these areas, not for want of parents’ efforts (Yousefian A, Leighton A, Fox K, Hartley D). It was not always like this. Many rural communities struggling today were at some point thriving, but as pointed out over a decade ago in a PBS News Hour broadcast, when jobs dry up, so does everything else. “We even had dry goods stores. We had a grocery storm. We had a pharmacy. We had all of that, a doctor’s office. But now it’s nothing here” (PBS).\nWhere Capital Starves\rEarlier I mentioned the high costs incurred by simply buying goods in food deserts, due in part to the logistics behind getting goods to them. That problem stems from a general lack of infrastructure designed to facilitate such a process in the first place. Of course, grocery stores and supermarkets themselves are forms of infrastructure, but neither can exist without a means of getting goods to them. Let us look at the state of Vermont. According to the visualization shown at the top of this page, Essex County is the poorest in the state of Vermont. Essex County also has within its boundaries many of the food deserts identified in the state (USDA). What makes these points important to my highlighting of logistics is that Essex County, on top of everything else, has some of the worst road connectivity in the state. To illustrate this, I want to consider the town of Brighton, one of the largest in the county. For food to get to store shelves in town, it may have to travel out from Boston or any number of large distribution center cities over to U.S. Route 91, and from there on to Vermont Route 114, a two-lane road (UVM). Consider the possibility of a bottleneck with a semi-truck going down that road to serve just around one thousand people, because that is one of the only major roads through Vermont that gets there. The only other option would be to drive up through New Hampshire and cut through Vermont Route 105, another two-lane road. Expecting ungodly-massive highways to connect a state of under one million is an unreasonable ask, and would frankly be a terrible waste of nature, but there is a real and noticeable disparity in the availability of rail or road infrastructure in Essex County compared to the rest of the state. The county I live in, Rutland County, has 14 state routes and 2 U.S. Routes travelling through it (VCGI). In comparison, Essex County has 3 and 1 respectively (VCGI). The only other county with as few major roads going through it as is Grand Isle County (VCGI), a chain of islands in Lake Champlain constituting about one-eighth the land. To be fair, Grand Isle County is more populous than its major roadway count counterpart but still—it is in the middle of a lake. Poor road connectivity lengthens trips, which may otherwise take less time, and when living in a place with few options for healthy food nearby, that matters a great deal.\nWhy Capital Starves\rThe state of infrastructure in Essex County could be chalked up to the minuscule share of the state population residing there, and the lower median incomes of those who do (USDA). Surely the state coffers must be a little light, and so few live there anyway, if there was anywhere that would be comparatively worse off it would make sense that it was there. However, this perspective ignores two key elements. First, that in 1890 the population of Essex County was once almost double what it is now (USCB). In fact, the population of the county at that time, though still lower than many other counties, was nearly three times that of that same group of islands in Lake Champlain which today outshine it (USCB). Second, that that should not matter at all. When talking about something like the rationality behind why a place is under-served by business or state infrastructure, we are ignoring that human beings with lives live there. That is the key tragedy in the neglect which many smaller rural communities face and which leads them to shrink, convulse, and collapse. Is it fair to blame businesses, particularly smaller businesses which lack the leeway granted by proceeds from other locations? Sort of, but not really. Why would someone go through the work of setting up a storefront, dealing with distributors, and getting the word out, if they cannot even find anyone to work (Alexander Marre) because of how rapidly people are leaving? This is generally an issue many rural areas face but it must be particularly hard among food deserts where people are even poorer and often even less in number.\nHow Capital Starves\rIn the same way that the universe is not necessarily cruel for each misfortune which we face, the worsening of conditions among small rural communities is not intentionally cruel. It is rational according to the economic order we have set. It is instead that that economic order is incompatible with rural life. Many rural communities at some point ate what they grew themselves almost exclusively, and food availability was less of a concern. Today rural communities are farming and gardening still, but sending what they collect to be processed and likely eaten somewhere else, turning around to find their own shelves empty (PBS). ” It’s really hard, because, you know, when I was coming up, we had greens and gardens and all that. But now you have to buy produce. So, it’s real hard for the kids” (PBS). Some would argue that the systems in place now are fundamentally the same as they were in the recent past but that is not true. The reach of these systems is what kills. Rural areas have long struggled with infrastructure, but that was generally fine when they were closed units, barring the odd harvest failure. When these same places no longer eat most of what they grow and when they must rely on the decrepit infrastructure for basic food, they suffer. The profit incentive leads not only to the neglect of infrastructure, but also to the wholesale ignorance of the predicament these people are in.\nCounterintuitively, businesses in rural areas tend to be more profitable than in other areas once they have gotten the chance to get running (Richmond FED, Atlanta FED), but the problem is that you need people with money, and you need people to work, and at this point a lot of the worst-hit communities have neither. Many rural areas depend on smaller banks as well (Richmond FED, Atlanta FED) and while they often do have an easier time getting financed, some areas are so small that they do not even have banks, or so poor that banks shut down (Courtney Brown) .\nTo give Vermont some quick credit though, as this is focused slightly on the state, things are not nearly as bad or exploitative in this sense as they are in some areas in the Midwest or South. Speaking about the Midwest in contrast I think the reason Vermont avoids some of the worst of this is just a different social understanding behind farming and community. The colonization of the Midwest and later West coast—tell me that is not what it was, I dare you—by the United States was a rushed affair telling people to go out and get land to find riches. The existence of many old railroad towns out in the heartland is entirely for profit. In contrast the colonization of New England was, to begin with, communities eking out sufficiency away from the British Isles or elsewhere. This is an oversimplification, absolutely, but I think it is important to point out.\nSolutions\rIf businesses don’t want to enter these communities, the solution is either to make it more appealing to do so or to return to a more closed loop. Either cut people in on the deal or let them live as they wish because the current half-measure is going to kill these places. The former option would take more work than the latter, but would ultimately be far better for everyone, the question is how to get there. There are a few ways government could act. State and federal authorities could improve infrastructure, which would provide jobs in the immediate term and reduce costs for businesses in the long term. They could also push financial incentives for businesses operating in rural areas, maybe vouchers or tax deductions. These are the two main ideas which come to mind, and they are not particularly new. This is already being done by some, but I’d argue it needs to be done more and by more states. The real issue is just getting businesses to go there and getting them over the startup hurdle.\nReferences\r1.

While wages went up (USBLS) and comparatively decent jobs remain available, half the country seems to think that we are back in 2008. Hell, unemployment is back to pre-pandemic levels (USBLS), with long-term unemployment (27 weeks or more) falling as well, and the federal funds rate, while rising steeply, just hit what it was around this same time in 2019 (FRED). It is not like nothing is going on, though, something must be off for people to be so concerned, so what is it? Prices. That is it, or a lot of it. The confluence of ongoing supply chain issues, a war in one of the most vital exporting countries in the grain market (WSJ) instigated by an important export country in the natural gas market, greed, and yes, to an extent the rapid expansion of the money supply from government assistance during the pandemic has worked out to a sharp rise in prices across the board. Is this concerning? Absolutely. Is this a recession? No. So why do I keep hearing the word?\nIgnoring the Data\rIn 2020 a global pandemic threw the global economy for a loop. Industries whose work could not easily be transferred online declined and millions of people were suddenly unemployed, and no one was sure when exactly things would end. Two years later and the pandemic is still close to us. Some of those millions who were unemployed, and many others, are dead now. But one could be forgiven for mistaking that things had passed with how little care many seem to have anymore. This general sense of apathy, or at least conscious ignorance, has grown so bad in fact that there is already some whole new pandemic and I have yet to hear a single real person share much concern over it. No one wants to care about anymore, and the governments of the world—which had at one time thrown enormous sums of money into the void which constituted their pandemic economies—have just as quickly dropped all mandates and shoved everyone back to the workplace. On one hand this makes sense, there is a feeling that prior to the pandemic things made some kind of sense and that organizations should return to their state of being. On the other hand, over one million people have died, just in the United States, and many are still dying, and no matter how much we choose to ignore it, things are not just going to become normal.\nBut what does any of that have to do with our present recessionary woes? A great deal, actually.\nThe trouble with selectively detaching yourself from the realities before you is that it becomes hard to keep up with everything else. While national economies are no strangers to emotion—look no further than the intense volatility of some stocks to see how impactful feelings can be—the degree to which many are now just going with their guts on this whole thing is almost unprecedented. The stubbornness with which we continue to ignore the presence of a deadly pandemic has made its way into how we think about a great many things. In this case then, “recession” has taken on a whole new meaning, realistically becoming a buzzword for “things are bad and I don’t like it,” or, more appropriately the current “bad vibes.” This situation is articulated well by Felix Salmon and Elizabeth Spiers in a recent episode of the podcast Slate Money;\n[Elizabeth Spiers] “I think people conflate their sense of financial security with a sense of overall stability and security in general. So if there is a lot of chaos happening in the world, they will automatically sort of assume that this is affecting them economically, even though it might not be the case.”\nGranted many are hit hard by soaring prices for goods but the point stands. A lot is happening, we have gone over this, and emotional overload is both very real and very reasonable given the state of affairs in the past few years but even still what could convince people that things are so unstable? One example could be the rollback of government programs as we reenter our faux normalcy, but the fact is that many of those programs worked in service of businesses more than individual people, at least directly.\nBut the Markets!\rNowhere do we see the presence of this “bad vibes” mentality more than in the stock market, the beating heart of volatility, and more importantly, something often conflated with economic health and well-being. As Felix Salmon says, “The stock market. Your stocks are down. Used to feel wealthy because stocks were up high and rising. Now you feel poor because stocks are lower and falling.” It really is a perfect kind of storm. For many years there has been this beating of the drum to instill the idea that the market and the economy are linked, and to be fair, it is not so much that they are not as it is that that is not the whole story. But nevertheless, people look towards this mythical thing for answers and right now it is not giving particularly good ones. At the same time people are again going with their guts and so there is a combination of feeling bad and then hearing dreadful things from one of the main places you look. This is not to mention how much big words catch headlines so I cannot help but side-eye publishers and agencies for opining the end of prosperity for clicks. The market was also just performing phenomenally while millions were unemployed and starving so again, it is not really reflective of how things are doing.\nThe Near Future\rOne of the most worrying things about this whole situation though is that, at the end of everything, economic health is genuinely dependent on our deeply personal faith in how things are going. When people lose faith, as many are, that’s when things start to go wrong fast. It is a tough situation because there are significant issues right now facing us down economically—the number of people presently unhoused is growing and rising costs certainly are not helping (Washington Post), and the minimum wage is nowhere near when it needs to be—and they are only magnified by the kind of fear that comes with words like recession. Luckily, the “vibe” has not yet soured enough for people to stop spending, which means that things might just work out if we can get inflation under control.\nReferences\r1.

When viewing data visualizations, keep in mind the direction of data more than what individual numeric values may be. As a final note, it could be possible that the realities of those experiencing houselessness over the past decade have been entirely different from what are identified as national trends, and were just masked under family houselessness, which is sometimes difficult to track accurately, especially given the limitations of the PIT count system, which only records individuals that can be found on the street one night a year. Data can be hard. Background and Overview\rWhen speaking about experiencing houselessness in the public space we are not often asked to think of the plight faced by those with few places to go, but instead to pity the poor homeowners who must bear witness. It is not the fault of the system that those people are without houses, it is fault on their own parts for forcing everyone to have to look at them. This is dehumanizing. Even less often though, are we asked to look at the racial disparities in communities experiencing houselessness that we dehumanize. The population experiencing houselessness in the United States is nearly 40% percent Black, triple the respective size of the Black community in America at large. This naturally leads to a simple question, why is the rate of people experiencing houselessness among Black Americans so high relative to the nation at large? Moreover, how could houselessness overall be combatted and why have such policies not been put in place? The next series of sections will explore these questions, first, by identifying potential factors behind houselessness, and then seeing if those factors are more prevalent or extreme among Black Americans than the national average, along with a look at why that may be the case through a historical lens. Finally, the last sections will discuss policy changes along with notes on how the public perception of those experiencing houselessness through portrayals in media has prevented those policy measures from being implemented. All data will be included at the end in the references section.\nVisualization Data Sources:\nHomelessness in America (GitHub)1,\rFHFA2,\rOECD3,\rCensus Bureau4,\rSt. Louis Fed5\nDefining Houselessness\rMost people have a very bare understanding of the concept of experiencing houselessness, mainly the part about not having a house, but defining houselessness on a policy level is a bit more layered. What constitutes a home may be vastly different to different people, so when trying to be objective with data, it is important to draw a line in the sand. Much of the data looked at in this paper will be either directly or indirectly sourced from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD hereinafter), so it follows to use the definition6 that they work with. According to the HUD, there are four categories under which a person or persons could be considered as experiencing houselessness, and these four are the ones that will reflect what houselessness means throughout this paper. The definition categories are as follows:\nIndividuals who lack a fixed, regular, and adequate nighttime residence. This includes people who may reside or have resided in emergency shelters.\nIndividuals and families who are in imminent danger of losing their primary nighttime residence.\nUnaccompanied youth and families with children and youth who are defined as homeless under other federal statutes who do not otherwise qualify as homeless under this definition.\nIndividuals and families who are fleeing, or are trying to flee, domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, stalking, or other dangerous or life-threatening conditions that relate to violence against the individual or a family member.\nElements contributing to houselessness tend to revolve around interruptions in the ability of a person or series of persons to carry out necessary activities to maintain their housing status. These include, but are by no means limited to, unemployment, domestic violence, substance abuse, incarceration, housing costs (lack of affordable housing), and changes in income level.7\nIdentifying Trends in Houselessness\rAccording to annual reports8 issued by the HUD to congress, the number of Americans who may be experiencing houselessness on any given night has been seen to have had a steady decline over the past decade with the reported Point-in-Time (PIT hereinafter) number as of January 2007 being 671,888, a decrease of approximately 6 percent compared against what was reported the previous year. Following the Great Recession, the rate of persons experiencing houselessness continued to decrease despite the rise in foreclosures as the housing bubble burst. The reported PIT number as of January 2009 was 643,067, the same time when housing prices were still dropping. Even by the beginning of 2012 when median housing prices had hit a new relatively low, the PIT number as of January was 633,782, although notably an increase from the previous year still overall saw a continuation of the decrease which had been taking place. This is important to find, not because of the actual change in housing prices, but because of what was resulting during this period. Established and time-tested financial institutions were collapsing under the weight of mass-defaults on mortgages, and the national economy was being put to the fire. During the midst of one of the worst recessions in American history, the number of recorded Americans experiencing houselessness was still generally on the downturn. This removes the notion of houselessness being strictly tied to market conditions, and this will be shown further when seen over a broader period. Maybe in the absence of necessary services the recession would have played a far greater role in pushing households off the deep end but that would only be evidence that houselessness would be a result of poor policy over economic realities.\nWhat can be seen most clearly when comparing trends in yearly housing pricing against trends in PIT numbers and unemployment is that even during periods where the housing market was recovering, PIT counts continued decreasing. Houselessness is a crisis of affordability, of being unable to meet growing costs, not simply of the costs themselves. People may have a variety of reasons for not being able to get something, why else would there be multiple categories by which houselessness is defined, but that reason is often just money. That difference can be shown by the change in unemployment rates as the national economy recovered. While the relationship between the two is not exact, PIT counts still decreased as unemployment rose, decreases in unemployment do appear to have been associated with greater reductions in PIT counts, even as housing prices rebounded. Comparing national income rates with PIT counts shows a similar trend to unemployment.\nElements like national income are associated with reductions in pit counts in some way, what is also clear from data collected and the data on display here is that the conversation on houselessness, while being a national one, is very probably heavily dependent on conditioned elements. There is in both cases, national unemployment and income, a reduction in houselessness overall regardless of the direction of either element. If these elements then, while being some of the most important determinants of houselessness, are not able to be identified as absolutely impactful, then the question becomes one of if these elements are more impactful when under certain conditions. If they can be identified as such, and in conjunction with other elements, like differences among states or regions, then this could be understood as government failing to meet the needs of its citizens with policy. This is all to say that there is, in fact, an important condition to consider here, race. Nearly 40% of persons experiencing houselessness are Black, and that jumps to over 50% of families.9\nA History of Oppression and Housing Discrimination\rThere are two primary elements to find. First, the extent to which centuries of oppressive and racist policies continue to affect modern communities in preventing the building of wealth, and second, the extent to which housing discrimination in particular has been involved. It should be of no surprise that enslavement prevented economic progress for Black Americans, what should however be an infinite source of shame for the nation is that this gap in progress has not been rectified, in fact, it has broadened as the effects of sweeping measures linger. Black Americans have been deprived of land, of labor, capital, and at many points of the tools to do anything about it. Jim Crow policies pushed children into schools that were underfunded and unprepared to even pretend to be supplying education at equal standards, and amazingly, even as outright segregation was outlawed, school districts across the country, particularly in areas like New York City, remain deeply segregated.10 At just this point a line could be drawn. It cannot be expected of an entire community of people to work from an uneven starting point and somehow reach the same endpoint in the same period. Yet things continue. Policies of unjust mass incarceration have separated Black American families, causing untold harm to children by completely removing parental figures in influential years, and leaving the parent that remains, if one remains, to simultaneously care for the child and work as a single parent.11 And these rates of incarceration are unjust, greatly fueled by minor drug offenses for which Black Americans have been historically targeted12, particularly in cases of marijuana, heroin, and crack cocaine, which was treated with much greater severity even for distribution than cocaine was, even though crack was just a far cheaper offshoot of cocaine.13 Even in where Black Americans live there have been policies that worked to their direct detriment. Housing discrimination. Entire towns wrote into their charters that only White residents would be permitted14 and in areas with sizable Black communities, policies like redlining across American cities made sure to absolute drive neighborhoods with a strong Black American presence into the ground by listing those areas as hazardous and starving them of investment and support in the form of federally insured loans from the government.15 On average, Black communities are poorer16, see underfunded education, and are more likely to see their members incarcerated, and all of these elements can be traced to policies still within the realm of recent history.17\nRedlined map of Atlanta, GA\nHouselessness is an issue of government failing to meet the needs of its citizens with policy, and the government has hardly ever pretended to meet the needs of its Black citizens.\nReanalysis of Trends\rUnemployment and income levels have been shown to have an impact on houselessness, and given the evidence supplied behind why Black communities often face greater levels of houselessness it is worth looking at by how much unemployment and income levels differ for Black Americans compared to the whole. With a solid difference found both aspects would be confirmed.\nThere is clear evidence of both disparities in employment and income, this furthers that historic and present policy decisions have continued to push Black Americans towards an economic position that is worse situated than that of White Americans, or, at least, have not acted to mend the rift.\nPolicy Initiatives\rOn the national level, individuals and families across the board are being pushed closer to the edge as costs of living outpace income, but as was said earlier, this is a crisis of affordability, and while rising costs of living are difficult enough to bear as is18, Black American communities find themselves doubly-assaulted by the simple fact that while costs go up everywhere, they still have less money to meet those costs. Solutions to such an issue can range from raising the minimum wage for all Americans, subsidizing housing and rental costs for persons and families at risk of becoming houseless19, and plainly giving people homes.20More targeted solutions specifically for Black Americans could revolve around investing in infrastructure and businesses in historically Black communities and criminal justice reform aimed at preventing the destruction of families and the limiting of cash bail.\nPopular Media and Public Perception\rWhat holds back rational policy initiatives is poor public perception of persons experiencing houselessness, which has been compounded by portrayals in media. Those experiencing houselessness are presented as failures in a difficult world, a sad story to be sure, but not one to be aided. It is their fault for allowing themselves to become houseless. To give credit to national media and those who hold this perception, any other more correct portrayal would actually need a level of introspection that most do not want to endure. The reality is that most American citizens are far closer to experiencing houselessness than they would like to imagine, and it is easier to just blame individuals for failing than to blame a system not supplying support to people in need.21\nConcluding Points and the Future\rHouselessness will continue throughout the United States for however long earnest steps are not taken to combat the problems behind it. PIT counts of houselessness have increased in the years since those in the visualizations presented. Only time will tell how much damage the COVID-19 pandemic has done. Moreover, the unequal distribution of who is experiencing houselessness will almost certainly persist in conjunction with houselessness overall as there appears to have been no real alteration of policies which keep the environment in which such inequalities may be fostered. Things are not all doom and gloom though, there are still fewer people experiencing houselessness than there were even prior to the Great Recession.
