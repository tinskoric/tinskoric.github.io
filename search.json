I can’t say if the show was still any good by that point (I stopped watching around season 5 in my youth) but I know, however anecdotal this is, that I did not hear a lick of news about it for the last 5 years. Actually its been more than 5 years, I haven’t heard anything in the general conscious since the death of Glenn and even that was only a blip in a growing stream of silence. I don’t want to bash on a show that has—mercifully—been over for 2 years now. Rather, my realization that The Walking Dead had crawled along for so long, and somehow with decent reviews online, has presented me with a fun question to explore:\n\nAre obvious metrics even reliable? Can we actually trust something like user reviews simply because they are collected in aggregate?\n\nThe immediate answer to the question posed is that user-reviews may be biased by selection bias. Sometimes, perhaps, we can trust user-review aggregates, but other times selection bias is too strong. This is because user-reviews are entirely voluntary at not one but two stages. First (excluding review-bombing), users presumably must choose to watch a show and form an opinion. Second, users must decide that their opinion is worth expressing online in a review. If, for example, a show is slowly dying and only the truest of true fans are left watching, the user-reviews will be biased in aggregate, because those who may otherwise negatively review the show have already dropped out at stage one. This phenomenon isn’t particularly difficult to grasp, but, I think The Walking Dead television show provides a very good example. For the next few sections, I’ll demonstrate how even obvious data can be difficult to trust by using a long-zombified, now-dead, television show as an example. Specifically, I will be looking at viewership statistics and IMDB ratings for The Walking Dead over time.\n\n\n2 The Walking Dead\nTo call The Walking Dead a “Zombie Show” in its final season would not only be reflective of its content by then, but too of its character. Despite facing declining average viewership as early as season 5, it trudged on for 6 more seasons. Before talking about reviews, I want to make sure that we are in agreement about the death of the show. Below is a graph displaying the television viewership counts in the United States of The Walking Dead per episode and split across seasons (“Sunday Cable Ratings [Multiple]” 2010-2018; “Showbuzz Daily Sunday Top 150 Cable Originals Network Finals [Multiple]” 2019-2022):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Zombie Show: TV Viewership of The Walking Dead by Episode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload Plot Download Animated Plot\n\n\n\nBy the above chart in Figure 1, viewership counts have faced a sustained decline since around the middle of season 5, with a notable spike in the first episode of season 7—the death of Glenn. Looking at the data, there is a fair criticism right off the bat: these are cable television viewership stats, and people have been cord-cutting (Rainie 2021) for years. What if, the show was not experiencing as dramatic a fall-off as I am depicting? Unfortunately, no, cord-cutting does not explain away the woes of the show. In fact, according to FCC (2019-2022), more people had cable subscriptions in 2018 than any year prior in the period from 2010 to 2022, and we know The Walking Dead was losing viewers long before then.\n\nPerhaps many with cable subscriptions just didn’t watch much cable anyways by then. As Molla (2018) points out, “Cable and satellite companies often include TV, internet and telephone for a single reduced price. For many [American cable subscribers], the cost they’d have to pay for internet alone isn’t much less than they would pay for all three services individually, so the perceived value can seem tempting. In turn, the cable companies are able to eke out higher overall monthly fees by throwing in those ‘extras.’” There could be many cable subscribers then and now who don’t actually take much advantage of their cable subscription. However, just because subscribers choose not to watch cable doesn’t mean they can’t. I am sure that if someone had easy access to something, the only reason they wouldn’t use it is because they don’t want to—if someone already has cable, the reason they wouldn’t be watching The Walking Dead is either because they don’t want to or they don’t have time to, and in the latter case, that seems not to have stopped viewership prior. Given what we know, the graph below is functionally the same as Figure 1 so I’ve put it in a collapsed note to avoid taking up too much space with graphs that convey similar points. If you’d like to view this second graph anyways, just click on the note to expand it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Same Graph as Figure 1 But Now Adjusted for Cable Subscription Figures\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Zombie Show: TV Viewership of The Walking Dead by Episode (Adjusted for Cable Subscriber Counts)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload Plot Download Animated Plot\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClearly the viewership decline was genuine, so what made people stop watching? If people could watch but did not want to—presumably—the show got worse, or at least worse than competitive offerings in similar categories at the time.\n\n\n3 The Problem with User Ratings\nCritics have been around forever, but only with the advent of review aggregators can we combine reviews from around the world and seemingly come to a general critic consensus on a show. However another—arguably more impactful—thing that aggregators did was “democratize” reviews. Now anyone from around the world can praise or hate on their media of the day. For the purpose of my guiding question from Section 1, I am focusing on user-reviews, which are both more plentiful and often more diverse at the level of individual ratings. If we can trust these reviews, surely they should tell us that The Walking Dead got worse (and that would explain why people stopped watching when they otherwise could watch). Below are two charts displaying Internet Movie Database (IMDB) viewer ratings of the show over time:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Zombie Show: IMDB Viewer Ratings of The Walking Dead Episodes by Season\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload Plot Download Animated Plot\nDownload Violin Plot\n\n\n\nAs seen in Figure 3, for the most part (excluding some real stinkers in season 10 apparently), reviews of the show remained positive throughout a dramatic and sustained loss in viewership. People tuned out—presumably because they didn’t like the show enough to watch anymore—but the reviews didn’t exactly nosedive. If we know people could watch the show, and we see the reviews weren’t totally tanking, why we fewer people watching? There are a few main possibilities:\n\nEven if the show wasn’t bad perhaps there were better shows. But this ignores the fact that people were already invested in one show. To completely stop watching a show you are already five seasons deep in just because another catches your eye just doesn’t sound likely.\nThe reviews are not reflective of the tastes of the general viewership. This is the one I want you to believe rather than the straw-man alternative I created.\n\nYou see, I don’t believe these ratings, and I have a simple explanation for why—despite how they have great sample sizes and average everything out—I don’t. I don’t believe these ratings because of the problem of selection bias from Section 1. People that watch shows are the ones that review them. If people become bored enough with a show to simply leave it, they stop reviewing it as well. This makes taking user reviews and aggregators seriously much more difficult.\n\nInterestingly, you can see very slightly that the the decrease in average reviews per episode and across seasons, is sharpest sometime around season 6 and 7, when there were still many people watching, but the slow trickle away of viewers had already begun. These reviews, given the scale of viewership then, likely included many from the general audience, rather than just die-hard fans, and are notably increasingly negative until there are fewer viewers. This observation aligns with the idea of reviews being biased near the end of the show by devoted viewers and as such I do not trust those reviews. Without watching these later seasons, and with a decade between myself and the last time I watched any of that show, I look to the dynamics of viewership to tell me if the show is worth watching and I don’t see good things.\n\n\n4 Conclusion\nI don’t want to entirely discredit user reviews—that would be foolish. Instead, I propose a simple rule for anyone looking at reviews for a show or any similar episodic medium: give weight to the early reviews because that’s when the most general of audiences that has ever watched the show will watch and review the show. If you want to know what awaits you as a viewer down the line, check viewership numbers rather than reviews—if you see a steady decline, you can probably assume the show gets drab for the average viewer by then. I know I have been a little cruel against The Walking Dead, but there is simply no way in hell reviews were only down a point near the end for a show that had fallen to a tenth of its peak viewership, and this demonstrates the value of taking reviews—no matter how big your sample size is—with a grain of salt.\n\n\n5 References\n\n\nFCC. 2019-2022. “FCC Annual Video Competition Report.” Federal Communications Commission. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cable_television_in_the_United_States#Statistics.\n\n\nMolla, Rani. 2018. “Americans Are Still Paying for Cable Because It’s Bundled with Their Internet.” Vox. https://www.vox.com/2018/3/20/17139756/reasons-americans-us-pay-cord-cable-tv.\n\n\nRainie, Lee. 2021. “Cable and Satellite TV Use Has Dropped Dramatically in the U.S. Since 2015.” Pew Research Center. https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2021/03/17/cable-and-satellite-tv-use-has-dropped-dramatically-in-the-u-s-since-2015/.\n\n\n“Showbuzz Daily Sunday Top 150 Cable Originals Network Finals [Multiple].” 2019-2022.

    "section": "2.1 Theoretical Model",
    "text": "2.1 Theoretical Model\nA theoretical model describes complex economic processes in simplified terms. Theoretical models do not aim to be perfect representations of an economy but aim to illustrate important relationships. The RCK growth model builds on microeconomic foundations, representing consumption-saving behavior by households and their interactions with firms in a dynamic environment (Cass 1965; Koopmans 1963). I consider the model without debt and deficits but with lump-sum taxes. In the model, households supply their labor and capital to firms in exchange for wages and rents (household income). Additionally, the government provides services for households with revenues raised via their taxing. The money households earn in income (less the amount paid in taxes) is then either put towards consumption—in the contemporaneous period—of the output goods and services produced by those firms or, is saved for consumption of those goods and services in a future period. Table 1 below defines the variables of the theoretical model presented in the next subsections:\n\n\n\nTable 1: Model Variables\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\text{Variable}\\)\n\\(~~~~~\\text{Description}~~~\\)\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\alpha\\)\nContribution of Capital to Output (\\(\\alpha&lt;1\\))\n\n\n\\(\\theta\\)\nCoefficient of Relative Risk Aversion (the preferences of individuals to “risk” their incomes towards consumption)\n\n\n\\(\\rho\\)\nRate of Time Preference (the reward for consuming in the immediate period)\n\n\n\\(r\\)\nInterest Rate (the reward for saving)\n\n\n\\(n\\)\nPopulation Growth Rate\n\n\n\\(g\\)\nGrowth Rate of Technological Progress\n\n\n\\(k\\)\nCapital Accumulation\n\n\n\\(w\\)\nWages\n\n\n\\(K\\)\nCapital Stock\n\n\n\\(L\\)\nLabor\n\n\n\\(A\\)\nEffectiveness of Factors of Production (Capital and Labor)\n\n\n\\(T\\)\nTaxes\n\n\n\\(G\\)\nGovernment Expenditure\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1.1 Firms\nThe production function of this model is a Cobb-Douglas function where firms operate under perfect competition. The production function is expressed in its intensive form:\n\\[\nY=F(\\frac{K}{AL},1) = f(k) = k^{\\alpha} \\label{eq:class_eq_1} \\tag{1}\n\\]\nProfit maximization yields the optimality conditions for wages and the interest rate:\n\\[\nr = f'(k) \\label{eq:class_eq_2} \\tag{2}\n\\]\n\\[\nw = f(k)-k(f'(k)) \\label{eq:class_eq_3} \\tag{3}\n\\]\n\\(\\eqref{eq:class_eq_2}\\) and \\(\\eqref{eq:class_eq_3}\\) indicate that the interest and wage rates correspond to the marginal product of capital and labor respectively.\n\n\n\n2.1.2 Households\nHouseholds make decisions to save or consume, considering future periods as well as the present, and their consumption-saving behavior is characterized by constrained utility maximization. Households want to maximize their utility across periods and into the future according to their risk and rate of time preferences. The coefficient of relative risk aversion defines the risk preferences of households and is expressed as:\n\\[\n\\theta=\\frac{-c(u''(c))}{u'(c)} \\label{eq:class_eq_4} \\tag{4}\n\\]\nThe constant relative risk aversion (CRRA) utility function takes this coefficient:\n\\[\nu(c(t))=\\frac{c(t)^{1-\\theta}}{1-\\theta} \\label{eq:class_eq_5} \\tag{5}\n\\]\ndefining utility according to consumption and risk preferences. Lastly, households maximize their utility according to the CRRA and their rate of time preference:\n\\[\n\\max{U} = \\int_{t=0}^{\\infty}e^{-\\rho{t}}u(c(t)) dt \\label{eq:class_eq_6} \\tag{6}\n\\]\nThe rate of time preference, \\(\\rho\\), illustrates the preferences of households for consuming more in the immediate period. In other words, it is the premium for impatience. While maximizing their utility, households face a dynamic budget constraint:\n\\[\n\\dot{k}=(r(t)-n-g)k(t)+w(t)-c(t)-T(t) \\label{eq:class_eq_7} \\tag{7}\n\\]\nwhich constrains their utility according to how much they can afford, as well as the no-Ponzi-game constraint (Friedman 1957), which restricts households from taking an infinite stream of rolling debt to pay off prior debts. The solution to the problem households face is found via applying the maximum principle on the Hamiltonian function:\n\\[\n\\mathscr{H}=\\frac{c(t)^{1-\\theta}}{1-\\theta}+\\lambda(t)[r(t)-(n+g)k(t)+w(t)-c(t)] \\label{eq:class_eq_8} \\tag{8}\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\lambda(t)\\) is marginal utility of consumption. Following the maximum principle, the optimality conditions for households:\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathscr{H}(t)}{\\partial c(t)}=0 \\label{eq:class_eq_9} \\tag{9}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathscr{H}(t)}{\\partial k(t)}=\\beta\\lambda(t)-\\dot{\\lambda}(t) \\label{eq:class_eq_10} \\tag{10}\n\\]\nalongside these two is a third, the transversality condition:\n\\[\ne^{-\\beta{t}}\\lambda(t)k(t)=0 \\label{eq:class_eq_11} \\tag{11}\n\\]\nwhich says that all capital saved should be put towards consumption by death since individuals can increase utility by increasing consumption (decreasing marginal utility \\(\\lambda\\)) within their lifetimes. In other words, there is no point in saving money you cannot use.\n\nCombining Equations \\(\\eqref{eq:class_eq_9}\\) and \\(\\eqref{eq:class_eq_10}\\) yields the intertemporal allocation of consumption also called the Keynes-Ramsey rule or Euler equation, which describes how households allocate for consumption over time. In per effective worker terms, the Euler equation is:\n\\[\n{\\dot{c} \\over c}(t)=\\frac{1}{\\theta}[r(t)-\\rho-\\theta{(n+g)}] \\label{eq:class_eq_12} \\tag{12}\n\\]\nwhere \\({1 \\over \\theta}\\) represents the elasticity of intertemporal substitution, which describes how much individuals are willing to reallocate consumption across periods of time—and thus how quickly households adjust to new equilibria. A low coefficient of relative risk aversion means a high elasticity of intertemporal substitution, which means that an individual is more willing to reallocate consumption from the present to the future.\n\n\n\n2.1.3 Government and General Equilibrium\nIn this implementation of the RCK model, government spending, \\(G(t)\\), is financed by lump-sum taxes, \\(T(t)\\):\n\\[\nG(t) = T(t) \\label{eq:class_eq_13} \\tag{13}\n\\]\nThe goods market equilibrium—national accounts identity—closes the model:\n\\[\nY(t)=C(t)+I(t)+G(t) \\label{eq:class_eq_14} \\tag{14}\n\\]\nBy Walras’s law, since the capital and labor markets are in equilibrium, the goods market is also in equilibrium."

    "text": "2.2 Dynamic and Steady State Equilibria\nThe dynamic equilibrium is described by the consumption function and dynamic budget constraint equations (loci) respectively:\n\\[\n{\\dot{c}}=\\frac{1}{\\theta}(f'(k)-\\rho)-(n+g) \\label{eq:class_eq_15} \\tag{15}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\dot{k}=f(k)-k(n+g)-c-T \\label{eq:class_eq_16} \\tag{16}\n\\]\nand the transversality condition from \\(\\eqref{eq:class_eq_11}\\), which helps to eliminate unstable trajectories. The steady-state equilibrium is achieved whereby \\(\\dot{c}=\\dot{k}=0\\), which results in the steady-state equations of the model:\n\\[\nk=({\\frac{\\theta(n+g)+\\rho}{\\alpha}})^\\frac{1}{\\alpha-1} \\label{eq:class_eq_17} \\tag{17}\n\\]\n\\[\nc=k^{\\alpha}-k(n+g)-T \\label{eq:class_eq_18} \\tag{18}\n\\]\nSince \\(\\alpha&lt;1\\), there is a negative exponent meaning that \\(\\theta\\) is at the denominator.

In the long run, an increase in \\(\\theta\\) results in capital accumulation, output, and consumption below the steady state. This can be observed in an example phase diagram:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Example Steady State When \\(\\theta\\) Increases (\\(\\theta\\) from 0.5 to 1.5)\n\n\n\nAs seen in Figure 1, an increase in \\(\\theta\\) results in the locus for consumption shifting leftward (the dashed black line is the initial steady state and the solid black line is the final steady state), which results in both a lower equilibrium level of consumption and capital accumulation. In the transition between the loci, as seen in arrows on Figure 1, consumption initially spikes in the short-run at \\(t=0\\) and then drops alongside capital accumulation, in the long run, following the red-colored saddle path of the first locus towards that of the second."

    "text": "3.1 Data Description\nI source most data on the Bosnian economy from the section covering Bosnia (ordered by country code as “BIH”) in the Penn World Table (Groningen Growth And Development Centre 2023). The data is annual, and observations in the Penn World Table for Bosnia begin in the year 1990 and end in the year 2019. For my data, I am only looking at the period from 1996 to 2007 for the initial steady state, and then the year 2008 for the change in risk aversion, \\(\\theta\\). Data on GDP, \\(Y\\), is recorded annually in millions at current purchasing power parity (PPP) of 2017 U.S. Dollars (USD). Data on consumption (\\(C\\)), investment (\\(I\\)), government spending (\\(G\\)), and net exports (\\(Nx\\)), are recorded as decimal shares of GDP that add to one for each year. Consumption as a share of GDP in the Penn World Table includes consumption of both domestic- and foreign-produced goods meaning that the value includes the share from imports, so although my model does not include net exports, I include it in Table 2 to show that the sum of GDP shares add to 1. Data on capital stock, \\(K\\), is recorded annually at current PPP of 2017 USD. Data on the labor share of GDP (\\(wN \\over Y\\)) is recorded annually. Additional data is collected from the World Bank. Data on the population growth rate, \\(n\\), is collected from a dataset covering global population growth rates (World Bank 2023). Data on the interest rate, \\(r\\), is collected from the series on deposit interest rates (World Bank 2024a). The data on the interest rate for Bosnia only began recording observations in 2002. Similarly, data on the tax rate is collected from the series on tax revenue as a percent share of GDP (World Bank 2024c). As with the interest rate, data in the World Bank series only begins recording observations very recently, with the first being in 2005—only three years to use for the average prior to the 2008 crisis. Total factor productivity data is derived via a dataset from Dieppe (2020) that contains values for total factor productivity recorded since 2001 as a percent. This can be used to calculate \\(g\\) for 2002 and onward by taking the changes between observations1. On the next page is a table listing all data and sources in detail.

    "section": "3.2 Parameters and Model Economy",
    "text": "3.2 Parameters and Model Economy\n\n3.2.1 Parameters for the Initial Economy\nI first find the average values for consumption, investment, government expenditure, net exports, and labor as a share of GDP over the 11-year period from 1996 (the first year after the Bosnian War) to 2007 (the last year before the 2008 crisis). These values are the representation of the initial steady state for the actual economy.\nI derive my initial parameters from those macroeconomic ratios and the equations of the model. The equilibrium condition for the wage rate described in Section 2.1.1 gives the following formula for \\(\\alpha\\):\n\\[\n\\alpha=1-\\frac{wN}{Y} \\label{eq:class_eq_19} \\tag{19}\n\\]\nwhich solves for \\(\\alpha\\), the contribution of capital to output according to the contribution of labor to output. I solve for its value using the average of \\(wN \\over Y\\) over a period from 1996 to 2007 and choose a value slightly below the solution. I choose a value below the solution, \\(\\alpha = {1 \\over 3}\\) so that Wolfram Mathematica cooperates. For \\(n\\) (the population growth rate), I take the average growth rate of the population over a period from 1996 to 2007 using World Bank data. The data on population growth is heavily skewed by the war in the 1990s with a positive average prior to 2008. In reality, the population has been steadily declining for decades and there are 1 million fewer persons in Bosnia today than in 1996. The reason that the average value for \\(n\\) prior to 2008 is positive is because the World Bank data asserts that the growth rate of the Bosnian population was \\(4\\%\\) in 1996. This I believe to be from repatriations and better record-keeping post-war. The Penn World Table offers population data as well (Groningen Growth And Development Centre 2023), but using that instead would result in problems that I will detail later. For \\(g\\) (the growth rate of technological progress), I take the average of the change in total factor productivity from 2002 to 2007. For \\(T \\over Y\\) (the exogenous ratio of taxes to output), I take the average tax revenue as a percentage of GDP from 2005 to 2007. It is assumed in the model that government taxation equals government expenditure, \\(G\\). For \\(\\rho\\) (the rate of time preference), I take the average deposit rate, r, over a period from 2002 to 2007 to calibrate the rate of time preference. I take an average because I want to know what the deposit rate generally was in the period prior to 2008. The rate of time preference is a parameter within the continuous function seen in Equation \\(\\eqref{eq:class_eq_6}\\) that can be related to the interest rate (a discrete-time variable). More specifically, if the interest rate is the price of time passing, the rate of time preference is the discount for getting things immediately. If the interest rate is higher, individuals place a greater discount on immediate prices.\n\nFor the initial coefficient of relative risk aversion, I take the estimate of \\(\\theta = 0.72\\) found by authors Gándelman and Hernández-Murillo (2015). This estimate is in line with those of similar middle-income countries from the paper in the same period. Additionally, the average value for the rate of time preference (\\(\\rho=0.03776\\)) obtained using the deposit interest rate is comparable to that (\\(\\rho=0.03678\\)) which is achieved using a formula based on the Euler equation expressed in the steady state. This formula is expressed as:\n\\[\n\\theta=\\frac{(r-\\rho)}{(n+g)} \\label{eq:class_eq_20} \\tag{20}\n\\]\nand is rewritten to solve for the rate of time preference, with the average (prior to 2008) values of the deposit interest rate, population growth rate, and growth rate of technological progress alongside \\(\\theta = 0.72\\) plugged in:\n\\[\n\\rho = r - \\theta(n + g) \\label{eq:class_eq_21} \\tag{21}\n\\]\nAs noted previously, the rate of time preference illustrates the preferences of households for consuming more in the immediate period. Equation \\(\\eqref{eq:class_eq_20}\\) describes risk aversion in terms that include the rate of time preference subtracting the interest rate. Rewriting this, Equation \\(\\eqref{eq:class_eq_21}\\) describes the rate of time preference in terms of risk aversion—adjusted by the growth rates of population and technological progress—subtracting from the interest rate. The higher the interest rate or lower the coefficient of relative risk aversion, the higher the rate of time preference—the premium for getting things sooner is higher when you are less concerned about risks. Of course, it is worth recalling that the rate of time preference is also a function of the interest rate alone. The resulting values from each method are close, which further evidences this to be a reasonable estimate for the initial coefficient of relative risk aversion.\n\nIn the steady state, my model underestimates the ratio of consumption, (greatly underestimates) investment and government expenditure to output:\n\n\n\nTable 2: Actual versus Model Economy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBosnia\n\\(~~~~~\\frac{C}{Y}~~~\\)\n\\(~~~~~\\frac{I}{Y}~~~\\)\n\\(~~~~~\\frac{G}{Y}~~~\\)\n\\(~~~~~\\frac{Nx}{Y}~~~\\)\n\n\n\n\nActual Economy\n\\(~~~~0.8390~~~\\)\n\\(~~~~0.2151~~~\\)\n\\(~~~~0.2546~~~\\)\n\\(-0.3024~~~\\)\n\n\nModel Economy\n\\(~~~~0.7704~~~\\)\n\\(~~~~0.0197~~~\\)\n\\(~~~~0.2099~~~\\)\n\\(~~~~0~~~\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is worth noting that a significant part of the Bosnian economy is constituted by imports that are not included in this model because it is a closed economy model. This discrepancy leads to the extremely low result for the level of investment in the model economy. We will see however that the dynamic response is more in line with what should be expected. In terms of national accounts, investment is solved for by taking the following difference:\n\\[\nI = Y - C - G - Nx \\label{eq:class_eq_22} \\tag{22}\n\\]\nand in the closed economy model \\(Nx=0\\):\n\\[\nI = Y - C - G \\label{eq:class_eq_23} \\tag{23}\n\\]\nEquation \\(\\eqref{eq:class_eq_23}\\) should look familiar, as it is the same as the goods market equilibrium from Equation \\(\\eqref{eq:class_eq_14}\\) shown in Section 2.1.3. The issue of the level of investment being underestimated cannot be solved by tweaking other parameters, the model is missing a piece of the puzzle—net exports. Any gains would only go to consumption since investment acts as a residual of output not used towards consumption. For example, because \\(T=G\\) in the model, it may be assumed from Equation \\(\\eqref{eq:class_eq_23}\\) that a lower value of the exogenous tax ratio parameter (\\(T \\over Y\\)) would lead to higher investment. However, this would ignore that consumption is still solved for first—simultaneously with capital accumulation—and would increase following a decrease in the tax ratio. This means that, in the model, consumption would assume all the gain from a cut in taxes before investment gets the chance to see any of it. Below is a table displaying the steady state were the tax ratio set to \\({T \\over Y}=0\\):\n\n\n\nTable 3: Actual versus Model Economy (No-Tax Example)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBosnia\n\\(~~~~~\\frac{C}{Y}~~~\\)\n\\(~~~~~\\frac{I}{Y}~~~\\)\n\\(~~~~~\\frac{G}{Y}~~~\\)\n\\(~~~~~\\frac{Nx}{Y}~~~\\)\n\n\n\n\nActual Economy\n\\(~~~~0.8390~~~\\)\n\\(~~~~0.2151~~~\\)\n\\(~~~~0.2546~~~\\)\n\\(-0.3024~~~\\)\n\n\nModel Economy\n\\(~~~~0.9803~~~\\)\n\\(~~~~0.0197~~~\\)\n\\(~~~~0~~~\\)\n\\(~~~~0~~~\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs seen in Table 3, the resulting share of investment within the model economy is identical to the share found in Table 2, and all gains from the tax cut go to consumption.\nWhatever the case, my model estimates the share of consumption in the Bosnian economy quite well, and I move forward with it despite the underestimation of investment. In my dynamic results and sensitivity analysis sections, I will demonstrate that my results are still robust despite this underestimation. Below is the table of parameters for the model presented in the next three subsections:\n\nParameters\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(~~~~~\\alpha~~~\\)\n\\(~~~~~\\theta~~~\\)\n\\(~~~~~\\rho~~~\\)\n\\(~~~~~n~~~\\)\n\\(~~~~~g~~~\\)\n\\(~~~~~{T \\over Y}~~~\\)\n\n\n\n\n\\(~~~~{1 \\over 3}~~~\\)\n\\(~~~~0.72~~~\\)\n\\(~~~~0.03776~~~\\)\n\\(~~~~0.00553~~~\\)\n\\(-0.00320~~~\\)\n\\(~~~~0.20990~~~\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2.2 Estimation of Change in Risk Aversion Between Steady States\nBetween steady states, I will be adjusting the value for \\(\\theta\\) to reflect the change in risk aversion. I was unable to similarly find an estimate for Bosnia or a like country immediately following the Global Financial Crisis, meaning that I had to arrive at my own estimation for \\(\\theta\\) for that period. Authors Gándelman and Hernández-Murillo (2015) derived their value (\\(\\theta=0.72\\)) using 2006 Gallup World Poll data and regressing a logarithmic risk utility function2 (\\(g\\)) on individual self-reports of happiness (\\(h\\)), income (\\(y\\)), and a series of controls (\\(x\\)) with the following model:\n\\[\ng(y)=\\begin{cases}\n\\frac{y^{1-\\theta}-1}{1-\\theta} \\text{ if } \\theta \\ne 1\\\\\n\\log(y) \\text{ if } \\theta=1\n\\end{cases} \\label{eq:HappyPaper1} \\tag{24}\n\\]\n\\[\nh_{i} = \\alpha + \\gamma{g(y_{i})}+x_{i}\\beta+v_{i} \\label{eq:HappyPaper2} \\tag{25}\n\\]\nWhile I would have liked to replicate this methodology given that it produces sound estimates, using Gallup World Poll data was not an option due to the cost involved. Instead, I attempt three different methods of estimation for \\(\\theta\\) in the second period, and I will detail each and their results.\n\nThe first method involves solving for \\(\\theta\\) using Equation \\(\\eqref{eq:class_eq_20}\\) with values of the interest and population growth rates, and the growth rate of technological progress, updated for the year 2008. As noted earlier, the population growth rate is positive if derived from the World Bank, and negative if from the Penn World Table over the 1996 to 2007 period. Although the latter appears more reasonable on the surface, \\(g\\) is also negative, and if both \\(n\\) and \\(g\\) are negative, the Equation \\(\\eqref{eq:class_eq_20}\\) returns very wonky (negative) estimates. So, while I acknowledge the real population growth may be negative (although it is fair to say that the conditions of the war make basically any estimate from the era difficult), I cannot use a negative value in the model. Further, \\(g\\) cannot reasonably be made positive for argument’s sake after being consistently negative for 2008 and the years immediately prior. I therefore resolve to use the averages of \\(n\\) and \\(g\\) for the period 1996 to 2008 to account for this issue, allowing \\(n\\) to remain positive. While it is not ideal, it is more reasonable to say that out of all of the variables involved in Equation \\(\\eqref{eq:class_eq_20}\\), population growth and technological progress rates are the least likely to significantly change in the course of a year absent emergency conditions. I then take the value of the deposit interest rate for 2008, calibrate the rate of time preference as I did with the average prior to 2008 in Section 3.2.1, and plug all the values into Equation \\(\\eqref{eq:class_eq_20}\\). The resulting estimate is \\(\\theta=1.61\\), which is higher than the estimates noted later, but is not unreasonable to see high jumps in risk aversion under the context of the Global Financial Crisis as seen in Bekaert, Engstrom, and Xu (2022).\n\nAlthough I cannot exactly replicate the methodology of Gándelman and Hernández-Murillo (2015), I can use their essential model \\(\\eqref{eq:HappyPaper2}\\) and substitute it with national rather than individual data. For example, instead of using individual reports of household income, I use per capita Gross Domestic Product. Similarly, rather than using individual reports of happiness, I use the OECD (2017b) Consumer Confidence Index which reflects consumer sentiments nationally. Although data for this index is not available from the OECD for Bosnia, there are a number of countries similar to Bosnia with data available. I choose Greece, Hungary, Slovenia, and Türkiye as they are countries near Bosnia that do not generally have hugely higher incomes (none except Slovenia have a GDP per capita greater than \\(\\approx\\)$20,000 current USD) and have OECD data available. While this is not a one-for-one replacement, these are sets of data that answer alike questions. For income and all other variables—except the Consumer Confidence Index—included in the model \\(\\eqref{eq:HappyPaper2}\\) I find national substitutes for Bosnia covering the period 1996 to 2008. Since not all variables are available monthly, I average the index yearly. Further, since some countries selected from the Consumer Confidence Index do not have data available for many periods prior to 2007 I average the index values for the four countries together yearly. I then regress the model over the period 1996 to 2007 to derive coefficients for each variable. Lastly, I plug in values for the year 2008 and solve for \\(\\theta\\) using the coefficients derived. The substitutes that I was able to find do not change all that much in 2008 relative to the prior years included, so the resulting estimate for \\(\\theta\\) in 2008 is almost equal to that of years prior. Ignoring the limited number of observation periods in this implementation, this method could be useful but the substitute values that I have found simply do not do well by it.\n\nThe last estimation method is to take the OECD (2017a) Consumer Barometer, which is the normalized change in the Consumer Confidence Index, and multiply the averaged yearly value for 2008 by the initial estimate (\\(\\theta =0.72\\)). The reasoning for this is that if a measure of happiness can be related to risk aversion—as it is inversely by Gándelman and Hernández-Murillo (2015)—and if the Consumer Confidence Index can be considered a substitute for such a measure, then the change in that index could be considered akin to a change in the prior measure, which would then mean a change in risk aversion. Since this is simply a change value that I am multiplying as a scalar rather than regressing, I am unconcerned by some countries not having data until the 2000s and select a range of values. I select from the four countries (Greece, Hungary, Slovenia, and Türkiye) for the ones with the least (Hungary, \\(\\Delta \\approx -0.06\\)) and most (Türkiye, \\(\\Delta \\approx -0.23\\)) negative average change in the Consumer Barometer for the year 2008. I also take the average (\\(\\Delta \\approx -0.13\\)) across all four countries. This results in three estimates: \\(\\theta=0.77, 0.81, 0.89\\). This is a good range of estimates, although the lowest one is only very marginally different from the initial value. It is worth noting that the low estimate for \\(\\theta\\) comes from the Consumer Barometer for Hungary, which is not considered a middle-income country, whereas the high estimate comes from Türkiye which is considered one. In fact, Türkiye is the only country of the four to be considered middle-income, so perhaps the higher estimate is a better characterization for Bosnia. To support this, looking at another middle-income country—albeit one not close to Bosnia—Brazil has an average yearly change that is more negative than the average of the four countries (\\(\\Delta \\approx -0.17\\)). With this in mind, and Bekaert, Engstrom, and Xu (2022), I think it best to focus on the highest estimate, \\(\\theta=0.89\\) of the three.\n\nWhile the second method would have been ideal, it was not feasible for the reasons outlined earlier. By contrast, the first and third methods each have some positives and negatives. For the former, it provides an estimate that feels sufficiently high given the circumstances while not requiring any particularly severe leaps of logic. However, the first method still requires me to hold constant some data that is not constant—even if it is slow-changing—and to make personal assumptions about data integrity under wartime conditions. For the latter, it requires only the assumption that consumer confidence and happiness are closely related. However, the third method provides much lower estimates than the first—not even the largest one is two-tenths greater than the pre-crisis estimate—and frankly, the numbers appear too low for a financial crisis based on analyses of changes in risk-aversion during the financial crisis (Bekaert, Engstrom, and Xu 2022). In all, I carry forward the former and latter as the high and low ends of a range of possible estimates. I also take the mean of the two \\(\\theta=1 .25\\) to serve as a middle-road estimate.\n\nRelative Risk Aversion (\\(\\theta\\)) Estimates for 2008\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(~~~~\\text{Low}~~~\\)\n\\(~~\\text{Middle}~~~\\)\n\\(~~~~\\text{High}~~~\\)\n\n\n\n\n\\(~~~~\\theta~~~\\)\n\\(~~~~0.89~~~\\)\n\\(~~~~1.25~~~\\)\n\\(~~~~1.61~~~\\)"

Of note is the way each variable of interest changes through time. Output begins at the equilibrium level and decreases with each successive period. By contrast, consumption and investment both begin outside the steady state level at the initial period of change, with consumption beginning above and decreasing thereafter, and investment beginning below and increasing to just below that level by the end. Just as before, based on Equation \\(\\eqref{eq:class_eq_15}\\) and Equation \\(\\eqref{eq:class_eq_16}\\), and the discussion in Section 2.2, it is clear why consumption decreases over time with the change in risk aversion—and since the variables of interest are all related, that explains the changes in the other variables. Consumption decreases because \\(\\theta\\) has increased and \\(\\theta\\) reduces consumption in the steady state equations. Recall that \\(1 \\over \\theta\\) represents the elasticity of intertemporal substitution and that if it is low—and with an increase in risk aversion, elasticity would become lower—individuals are more willing to save rather than consume in a single period. Output decreases because it is a function of capital accumulation from the intertemporal budget constraint, and since the capital accumulation decreases to maintain equilibrium when consumption decreases, so does the output. Investment begins below equilibrium and rises to a point still below the initial steady state because it must reflect the national accounts identities as seen in Equation \\(\\eqref{eq:class_eq_21}\\). Since government expenditure is an exogenous constant and this model simulates a closed economy, the only two things that constitute output and can change in terms of national accounts are consumption and investment. Output begins at the equilibrium steady state level and decreases in dynamic simulations, but consumption begins above the steady state and decreases. This means that investment must begin below and rise (although still to a point below equilibrium) for the national accounts identities to hold. These dynamics are consistent with the theory outlined in Section 2.1, and evidence that the model is robust even if it imperfectly estimates the levels.\n\nIn the long run, the variables of interest are all below the initial equilibrium level. However, in the earlier periods, consumption is still above the initial steady state, and investment is far below. Looking at Table 6, one can see the changes in the growth rates of the variables over time. By year 10, output and investment are down by \\(0.16\\%\\) and \\(17.58\\%\\) respectively, and consumption is up by \\(0.28\\%\\) when \\(\\theta=0.89\\). However by year 20, output is down by \\(0.27\\%\\) but investment is down by only \\(12.28\\%\\)—indicating that investment is actually increasing back towards the original equilibrium, as seen in Figure 2 (c)—and consumption is up by only \\(0.03\\%\\) when \\(\\theta=0.89\\)—indicating that consumption is decreasing as seen in Figure 2 (b). This same story plays out across all values of \\(\\theta\\). In year 10 when \\(\\theta=1.25\\), output and investment are down by \\(0.43\\%\\) and \\(47.05\\%\\) respectively, and consumption is up by \\(0.77\\%\\), whereas by year 20 output and investment are down by \\(0.73\\%\\) and \\(35.15\\%\\) respectively, and consumption is up by \\(0.15\\%\\). In year 10 when \\(\\theta=1.61\\), output and investment are down by \\(0.61\\%\\) and \\(69.51\\%\\) respectively, and consumption is up by \\(1.15\\%\\), whereas by year 20 output and investment are down by \\(1.08\\%\\) and \\(54.16\\%\\) respectively, and consumption is up by \\(0.28\\%\\). As can be seen, the larger the increase in \\(\\theta\\), the sharper the initial spike and downturn in consumption and investment respectively. Additionally, looking at Table 5, the growth rates of output and consumption are always lowest and investment always highest in year 20 when compared to year 5 respectively, which makes sense given what was observed in Table 6. For example, in year 10 when \\(\\theta=1.61\\), output, consumption, and investment are \\(2.89\\), \\(2.27\\), and \\(0.02\\) respectively, whereas by year 20 output, consumption, and investment are \\(2.88\\), \\(2.25\\), and \\(0.03\\) respectively."

To determine a new value for the rate of time preference (\\(\\rho\\)), I first search for a new value for the interest rate \\(r\\) and then solve for the value of \\(\\rho\\) as in Section 3.2.1. To find this value, I must change my source of data from the deposit interest rate to something else and take its average. Many typical sources for this rate—bond yields and corporate rates—were not available for the 2007 and prior time periods. I elect to use data on the net interest margin of banks in Bosnia from the World Bank (code: GFDD.EI.01). This records the net interest revenue of banks as a share of their interest-bearing assets, meaning that it illustrates the relative rate of interest banks see yearly.

This slight difference in the time path for consumption leads the time path for investment to increase further as time passes. This dynamic of consumption dropping more steeply with time makes sense intuitively: a higher rate of time preference—the premium for impatience—will result in greater emphasis being placed on consumption in earlier years, with later years increasingly written off. These dynamics show that the model is fairly robust."

    "text": "5.2 A New Value of Taxation (\\(T \\over Y\\))\nGiven the exogenous nature of the tax ratio, it is worth investigating the effects of changing it in the model. As in Section 3.2.1 when discussing the underestimation of investment in the steady state, government spending takes out a share of GDP in the national accounts identities of Bosnia, but a decrease in it would exclusively go towards a higher steady-state level of consumption. It is worth investigating if there are any other dynamic differences from a change in taxation. By all accounts, there should not be. For this adjustment in the tax ratio, I do not set it to zero, but instead to a slightly higher level. I take the average of government expenditure for the years 2005 to 2007 from the World Bank (2024b) and set the tax ratio to \\({T \\over Y}=0.34228\\). This new value means that over \\(34\\%\\) of output will go towards taxation.\n\n\n5.2.1 Data and Model\nAdjusting the model to simulate the economy with a new value for the tax ratio does not require any changes to it, only to the value of \\(T \\over Y\\).\n\n\n\n5.2.2 Results\nOnly \\(c\\) has a different—higher— steady-state value when compared to Table 4.  ::: {#tbl-stdy-tsy layout-ncol=“2”} | | \\(~~~~~y~~\\) | \\(~~~~~c~~\\) | \\(~~~~~i~~\\) | |—————–|———-|———-|———-| | \\(\\theta=0.72\\) | \\(~~~2.91\\) | \\(~~~2.24\\) | \\(~~~0.06\\) | | \\(\\theta=0.89\\) | \\(~~~2.89\\) | \\(~~~2.23\\) | \\(~~~0.06\\) | | \\(~~~\\Delta\\) (%) | \\(-0.50\\) | \\(-0.47\\) | \\(-1.49\\) | | \\(\\theta=1.25\\) | \\(~~~2.86\\) | \\(~~~2.21\\) | \\(~~~0.05\\) | | \\(~~~\\Delta\\) (%) | \\(-1.53\\) | \\(-1.45\\) | \\(-4.52\\) | | \\(\\theta=1.61\\) | \\(~~~2.83\\) | \\(~~~2.19\\) | \\(~~~0.05\\) | | \\(~~~\\Delta\\) (%) | \\(-2.53\\) | \\(-2.41\\) | \\(-7.40\\) |\n\n\n\nTable 8: \\({T \\over Y}=0.20990\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(~~~~~y~~\\)\n\\(~~~~~c~~\\)\n\\(~~~~~i~~\\)\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\theta=0.72\\)\n\\(~~~2.91\\)\n\\(~~~1,85\\)\n\\(~~~0.06\\)\n\n\n\\(\\theta=0.89\\)\n\\(~~~2.89\\)\n\\(~~~1.85\\)\n\\(~~~0.06\\)\n\n\n\\(~~~\\Delta\\) (%)\n\\(-0.50\\)\n\\(-0.47\\)\n\\(-1.49\\)\n\n\n\\(\\theta=1.25\\)\n\\(~~~2.86\\)\n\\(~~~1.83\\)\n\\(~~0.05\\)\n\n\n\\(~~~\\Delta\\) (%)\n\\(-1.53\\)\n\\(-1.44\\)\n\\(-4.52\\)\n\n\n\\(\\theta=1.61\\)\n\\(~~~2.83\\)\n\\(~~~1.81\\)\n\\(~~~0.05\\)\n\n\n\\(~~~\\Delta\\) (%)\n\\(-2.53\\)\n\\(-2.38\\)\n\\(-7.40\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n: \\({T \\over Y}=0.34228\\) {#tbl-stdy-tsy2}\nSteady States (With Higher Tax Ratio \\(T \\over Y\\)) :::\nThe resulting steady state with the updated value of \\(T \\over Y\\) shows no change to investment as a share of GDP, with taxes assuming a portion of the share held prior by consumption. The model now underestimates consumption and still greatly underestimates investment in the steady state. As seen in ?@tbl-stdy-tsy, just as in Table 4, no matter the value of \\(\\theta\\), all variables of interest decrease between steady states. When \\(\\theta=0.89\\), output, consumption, and investment decrease by \\(0.50\\%\\), \\(0.47\\%\\), \\(1.49\\%\\) respectively.

When \\(\\theta=1.61\\), output, consumption, and investment decrease by \\(2.53\\%\\), \\(2.38\\%\\), and \\(7.40\\%\\) respectively. However, only the steady state levels and changes of consumption are different per each value of \\(\\theta\\) when ?@tbl-stdy-tsy2 and Table 8 are compared—the levels are the same for output and investment as in Table 4 as well as the changes between steady states. The change to the tax ratio has almost no effect beyond snatching some of the share of output once held by consumption. Unlike the change to \\(\\rho\\) from the prior section, output is not reduced at all by this change to \\(T \\over Y\\), and instead, it is the ratio of consumption to output that is changed, rather than the level of output. This is consistent with Section 3.2.1, where it was demonstrated in Table 3 that changes in taxation only affect consumption in the RCK model.\n\nUsing the new value for the tax ratio, I simulate the quantitative impacts on the Bosnian economy of the increase in risk aversion from the 2008 crisis. Below are time paths comparing the change in the coefficient of relative risk aversion depending on the value of the tax ratio (\\(y\\), \\(c\\), \\(i\\) when \\(\\theta\\) increases from \\(0.72\\) to \\(1.61\\) for when \\(T \\over Y\\) is \\(0.20990\\) and \\(0.34228\\), \\(t=\\) years):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Evolution of Output (\\({T \\over Y}=0.34228\\))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Evolution of Consumption (\\({T \\over Y}=0.34228\\))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) Evolution of Investment (\\({T \\over Y}=0.34228\\))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Evolution of Variables of Interest over Time after 2008 Crisis (With Higher Tax Ratio \\({T \\over Y}\\))\n\n\n\n The dashed and dotted lines in the above figures show the steady state prior to the change in \\(\\theta\\) when \\({T \\over Y}=0.20990\\) and \\({T \\over Y}=0\\) respectively. As can be seen, the resulting changes lie entirely with consumption, with it being significantly higher in level at all points in the time path. Do these results imply anything about tax cuts as a policy to stimulate investment? Not really. Again, this is more a reflection of the shortcomings of a closed economy model imposed on an economy with a high trade deficit. However, it is not unreasonable to say that cutting taxes to spur investment would similarly not function as a one-to-one interaction, with much of the difference rather being saved or consumed. Either way, the dynamics of the model are identical following the change in the tax ratio, with consumption only being higher in absolute level. This is consistent with what was discussed in Section 3.2.1, and is further evidence of robustness in terms of dynamic results from the model."

    "text": "5.3 Introducing Depreciation (\\(\\delta\\))\nGiven that assets in the real world tend to depreciate, it is worth investigating how introducing a rate of depreciation may impact the model. In the real world, capital depreciation leads to investment in capital stock. Existing machinery, for example, cannot be relied on forever, and must be updated eventually. However, even if introducing depreciation increases the share of investment in output, that share would come from what was held by consumption—taxes are static and exogenous and there are still no trade flows—thus reducing its share of output. However, knowing that these dynamics would be the likely result of the introduction of depreciation to the model, it is worth seeing by how much the shares of each of these things are changed in the steady states and dynamic simulations.\n\n\n5.3.1 Data and Model\nIntroducing a non-zero value for depreciation, \\(\\delta\\), adjusts the formulation of the model. The optimality conditions for firms are changed such that Equation \\(\\eqref{eq:class_eq_2}\\) is rewritten as:\n\\[\nr = f'(k)-\\delta \\label{eq:class_eq_26} \\tag{26}\n\\]\nwhich results in new equations of the loci:\n\\[\n\\frac{\\dot{c}}{c}=\\frac{1}{\\theta}(f'(k)-\\rho)-(\\delta+n+g) \\label{eq:class_eq_27} \\tag{27}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\dot{k}=f(k)-k(\\delta+n+g)-c-T \\label{eq:class_eq_28} \\tag{28}\n\\]\nand new steady-state equations:\n\\[\nk=({\\frac{\\theta(\\delta+n+g)+\\rho}{\\alpha}})^\\frac{1}{\\alpha-1} \\label{eq:class_eq_29} \\tag{29}\n\\]\n\\[\nc=k^{\\alpha}-k(\\delta+n+g)-T \\label{eq:class_eq_30} \\tag{30}\n\\]\nData on the depreciation rate is sourced from the Penn World Table as an average for the 1996 to 2007 period for Bosnia. The resulting steady state with \\(\\delta\\) shows a large change to consumption and investment as shares of GDP. The model now underestimates the share of consumption with the difference being added to the share of investment. This makes sense and follows the theoretical explanation outlined earlier—capital depreciation spurs investment in capital stock, resulting in a larger share of output being diverted to investment.\n\n\n\n5.3.2 Results\nThe steady-state outcomes across values of \\(\\theta\\) show a clear departure from those found in Table 4.

When \\(\\theta=1.61\\), output, consumption, and investment decrease by $23.09%$, $7.80%$, and \\(54.50\\%\\) respectively. However, both the steady-state levels per each value of \\(\\theta\\), and the changes between them are all very different. Introducing depreciation, \\(\\delta\\), greatly reduces the steady-state levels of output and consumption across all values of \\(\\theta\\) and greatly magnifies the size of their changes between steady-state levels. Additionally, the results of investment are very significantly affected by depreciation. The dynamic response of investment is increased ten-fold and decreases sharply between \\(\\theta\\) values. The introduction of depreciation has both reduced output and changed the respective shares of consumption and investment in it. A change in the level makes sense intuitively. First, if assets depreciate output is lost by their depreciation. Second, if assets depreciate, it is necessary to invest in them to prevent further losses to output. Together these two realities explain the level but not the dynamic response.\n\nUsing the new value for depreciation, I simulate the quantitative impacts on the Bosnian economy of the increase in risk aversion from the 2008 crisis.

As can be seen, the resulting changes starkly contrast the initial time paths seen in Figure 2. For example, output and consumption begin above their steady states as still expected but decrease so sharply that the first few periods are cut off from the graphs. Investment, by contrast, sees the opposite and is significantly higher across time when compared to Figure 2 (c). The dynamics here are very different from those of the model without depreciation, and evidence that my results with the baseline calibration are not robust to new values of \\(\\delta\\) as far as the dynamic response to investment is concerned."

    "text": "🏡   Resume\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 Introduction\nThe Phillips curve occupies a curious space in post-pandemic economics discourse. While considered “dead” by some, and with some of the strongest evidence for its death coming from the reversal in relationship between inflation and unemployment during that period, it is worth investigating if the issue is the relationship itself, or instead a misspecification of it. Given the significance of both inflation and unemployment concerning economic health, a relationship between the two is an important guide for economic policymakers. To investigate this relationship and how it holds up in 2023, I take quarterly economic data on the United States economy and adopt an econometric variant of the Phillips curve relationship developed by Gordon (2013) and evaluate how well the econometric model matches real values for inflation in the economy. I find that the relationship between unemployment and inflation is indeed still an inverse one, at least in aggregate, with the coefficient on the contemporaneous unemployment gap (unemployment less the natural rate of unemployment) being -0.1097, meaning that the inflation rate is that much lower per 1-point increase in the unemployment gap of the current period. Additionally, I find that the model by Gordon (2013) accurately simulates values for inflation given data from the period.\n\n\n2 Literature Review\nThe traditional Phillips curve (traditional curve hereafter) comes from a relationship identified by Bill Phillips between wage pricing and unemployment which was broadened to be defined as one between inflation and unemployment. According to the traditional curve, inflation and unemployment are inversely related—as one goes up, the other goes down. This curve is taught in introductory macroeconomics courses. Given the significance of both inflation and unemployment concerning economic health, the relationship identified between the two took on an important role of its own—a guide for economic policy. Unfortunately for the proud curve (relating two stationary processes), the relationship would not survive the pains of the 1970s.\n\nThe 1970s saw a period of stagflation—high inflation conjoined by high unemployment. This was a total reversal in the prior-established relationship of the traditional curve and signaled its weaknesses for the years to come. In response to this change, Robert J. Gordon developed what would become known as the “triangle model” (Gordon et al. 1977; Gordon 1981). In the model, Gordon defines the inflation rate as being dependent on three fundamental elements: underlying inflation, inertia; aggregate demand-pull inflation, demand; and cost push inflation, supply. The first is a lagged rate of inflation, the second is an “[…] index of excess demand” Gordon (1997), which in this case is the unemployment gap, and the third is a number of supply shocks (e.g., food and energy price indices, etc.). For the unemployment gap, Gordon (1997);Gordon (2013) follows the methodology of Staiger, Stock, and Watson (1997) to derive a time-varying natural rate of unemployment (TV-NAIRU hereafter). This method involves regressing lags of the unemployment rate—alongside some supply shock variables depending on who is doing this, Gordon (2013) says excluding shocks for the TV-NAIRU results in better estimates—on the change in inflation, then dividing the intercept coefficient by the coefficients on the lagged unemployment rate regressors and applying a cubic spline. Consider a model where core inflation is regressed on four lags of the unemployment rate:\n\\[\n\\pi_{t} = \\beta_{0}+\\beta_{1}u_{t-1}+\\beta_{2}u_{t-2}+\\beta_{3}u_{t-3}+\\beta_{4}u_{t-4} \\label{eq:eq_NAIRU1} \\tag{1}\n\\]\nwhere the NAIRU could be derived via Staiger, Stock, and Watson (1997):\n\\[\n\\overline{u} = \\frac{\\beta_{0}}{\\beta_{1}+\\beta_{2}+\\beta_{3}+\\beta_{4}} \\label{eq:eq_NAIRU2} \\tag{2}\n\\]\nDoing this over an extended period with a cubic polynomial spline function, one can derive values for the TV-NAIRU through time. Underlying inflation is lagged, demand pull, and cost push inflation can be both contemporaneous and lagged. A simple implementation of the triangle model would be:\n\\[\n\\pi_{t} = \\beta_{0}+\\beta_{1}\\pi_{t-1}+\\beta_{2}(u_{t}-\\overline{u_{t}})+\\beta_{3}X_{t} \\label{eq:eq_NAIRU3} \\tag{3}\n\\]\nwhere Χ is a matrix containing whatever cost push supply shocks are being used. Gordon’s model proved itself to be capable of providing reasonably accurate estimates for inflation, and Gordon himself loves to tout some of the achievements of the triangle model—a prime example: “[…] the model explained in advance in 1982 why the inflation rate fell so rapidly during 1981-86” (Gordon 2013). There are, however, many other variations of the traditional curve. One popular variation is the accelerationist Phillips curve.\n\nThe accelerationist Phillips curve (accelerationist curve hereafter) can be traced to Gordon (1968) and takes the relationship of the traditional curve but supplants the unemployment rate with the unemployment gap—just as the triangle model—and the inflation rate with the change in the inflation rate. The change in the inflation rate is derived by simply taking the first differences between periods. Friedman noted that inflation was dependent on inflationary expectations and that individuals’ expectations for inflation were conditioned by past values of it. An implementation of the accelerationist curve could look like (Ball and Mazumder, 2015):\n\\[\n\\pi_{t}-\\pi_{t-1} = \\alpha(u_{t}-\\overline{u_{t}})+\\epsilon_{t} \\label{eq:eq_accel1} \\tag{4}\n\\]\nrewriting this also helps explain why the triangle model uses inflation as the dependent variable and as regressors rather than a change in inflation:\n\\[\n\\pi_{t} = \\pi_{t-1}+\\alpha(u_{t}-\\overline{u_{t}})+\\epsilon_{t} \\label{eq:eq_accel2} \\tag{5}\n\\]\nThis somewhat resembles the simple form of the triangle model displayed earlier. Although the accelerationist curve was thought up prior to the stagflation of the 1970s, it too—just as the triangle model—does a better job of making sense of that period and the periods to follow than the traditional curve does. Unfortunately, the accelerationist curve does not do as well when presented with inflation and unemployment trends of the late-2000s to early-2010s.\n\nAs Gordon (2013) points out, the Phillips curve—including the accelerationist curve (Ball and Mazumder, 2015)—does not do an excellent job at explaining late 2000s inflation. The estimates for inflation, given data on unemployment and prior inflation, should be negative (e.g., we should be seeing deflation according to the traditional and accelerationist curves). This problem is referred to as the missing deflation puzzle as we are seemingly overdue for deflation. Generally, there are two groups with two respective explanations for the missing deflation puzzle (Ball and Mazumder, 2015). James Stock and Robert Gordon (Gordon 2013) say that the problem lay with the unemployment rate being used and argue that the correct specification to solve the missing deflation puzzle would focus on short-term unemployment (e.g., 26 weeks or less) rather than total unemployment. Focusing on short-term rather than total does help explain why “[…] inflation has not fallen by more, because short-term unemployment rose less sharply than total unemployment over 2008-2009 and has since returned to pre-recession levels” (Ball and Mazumder, 2015). Alternatively, other economists argue that the long-standing commitment to a 2% inflation target in the United States has led inflationary expectations to become anchored, preventing “[…] actual inflation from falling very far below that level” (Ball and Mazumder, 2015). But Gordon (2013) also focuses on supply shocks as a crucial factor in modelling inflation and points plainly to the triangle model—whatever the unemployment specification—as a solution to the missing inflation puzzle. This is what most differentiates the triangle model from, say, the accelerationist curve.\n\nThe triangle model not only does well in accounting for the trends of the 1970s, but unlike the accelerationist curve also does well in accounting for the trends of the late 2000s. According to Gordon (2013), there is hardly even a deflation puzzle at all, and the problem sits squarely with specifications. In fact, Gordon goes as far as to write “[…] all of the NKPC [New-Keynesian Phillips Curve] literature over the past 15 years, as well as most other research on inflation, fails to include explicit variables to measure the impact of supply shocks. As a result, their misspecified equations attempt to explain the inflation rate that depends on both demand and supply with only a demand variable” (Gordon 2013). Fighting words by the standards of academia—as an aside, simply imagine a respected academic in your field refer to your hard work like this. Regardless, that is how things stood as of 2013.\n\n\n3 Data\n\n\n\nTable 1: Summary Statistics (Q1 1947-Q2 2023)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariables1\nn\nmean\nsd\nmin\nmax\nrange\nse\n\n\n\n\nPCECTPI\n306\n51.457\n33.021\n11.557\n120.044\n108.487\n1.888\n\n\nJCXFE\n258\n58.711\n30.943\n15.515\n118.938\n103.423\n1.926\n\n\nUNRATE\n302\n5.718\n1.7\n2.567\n12.967\n10.4\n0.098\n\n\nST_UNRATE\n302\n4.711\n1.25\n2.497\n12.246\n9.749\n0.072\n\n\nOPHNFB\n306\n62.283\n26.87\n23.258\n115.405\n92.147\n1.536\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe data collected for this paper is sourced primarily from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA hereafter) and the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS hereafter) via the St. Louis Federal Reserve database (FRED hereafter). The individual datasets are included in the references section, and my compiled datasets are included in the appendix. The FRED stores huge swathes of data from various national and international sources and is dependable. PCECTPI is the Personal Consumption Expenditures index (PCE Headline hereafter), JCXFE is the Personal Consumption Expenditures Less Food and Energy index (PCE Core hereafter), UNRATE is the unemployment rate, ST_UNRATE is the short-term unemployment rate, and OPHNFB is the productivity of nonfarm labor by output per hours worked. The data is quarterly time-series data ending in Q2 2023, with some sets of data being available further back in time than others. Data on the unemployment rate, for example, is available from the BEA as far back as Q1 1948, while PCE Core is only available starting at Q1 1959. All data sourced externally is available by the 1960s and onward. With this in mind, I exclude all data prior to Q1 1960 before making any further changes. I do not end up using short-term unemployment in the triangle model implementation adopted from Gordon (2013) but, I include it with the other data because it is available. I exclude the date variable from the summary statistics tables because it is unnecessary.

The data compiled was transformed to create additional variables (e.g., inflation, differences, changes, moving averages, trends) including a dummy variable, NIXON (subdivided into nixon_price_on and nixon_price_off), that was added to account for the price controls of the Nixon administration using values defined by Gordon (1997);Gordon (2013). Inflation variables are calculated by taking the change between years by quarter in the PCE Core and Headline price indicies. The changes in inflation are calculated by taking the first differences of inflation. The moving averages of inflation are calculated by taking the difference of inflation in one period and the natural logarithm of inflation four quarters prior (Gordon 2013). The food energy effect is the difference between PCE Headline and PCE Core and the food energy effect (late period) is a binary dummy variable where observations prior to 1987 are set to 0 and observations after are equal to the former (Gordon 2013). LT_UNRATE is long-term unemployment and is the difference between UNRATE and ST_UNRATE. The the 8-quarter productivity trend is derived from the 8-quarter percent change in OPHNFB (8-quarter actual productivity) with a Hodrick-Prescott filter (λ = 6400) applied (Gordon 2013). A Hodrick-Prescott filter is useful for just getting the long-run trends of data and Gordon makes effective use of it because of that. This dataset was also compiled in R (see appendix: “DATA.R” and “DataComplete.csv).

The PCE Core inflation change variable is missing an observation for Q1 1960 but otherwise all variables have observations from then onward. Below is a comparison between Core and Headline PCE:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Headline vs. Core PCE Inflation\n\n\n\nLastly, since the accelerationist curve and triangle model use the unemployment gap rather than the unemployment rate, I estimate values for a TV-NAIRU. I create my estimates not by the cubic polynomial spline regression employed by Staiger, Stock, and Watson (1997) and Gordon (1997);Gordon (2013) but instead by running a rolling regression of the unemployment rate on Core PCE inflation. I chose to follow this method under the advice of Professor Sicotte as the alternative spline method was difficult to manage. A rolling regression is easier to implement as it functions as a regular linear model but allows for change over time between periods defined by a “window” of observations. Recalling the earlier regression specification (equation 1) from the literature review, I use the same model but run a rolling regression with a window with a 52-quarter width. I then derive TV-NAIRU estimates according to equation 2 derived from the example by Staiger, Stock, Watson, (1997). The estimates for the TV-NAIRU (NAIRU) achieved by this method are around where one would expect a NAIRU value to be but, the estimates are jagged and change noticeably between individual periods. This is not something wanted from a variable meant to demonstrate long-run trends but luckily this can be resolved by running a Hodrick-Prescott filter (λ = 1600) on the estimates to return smoothed values (NAIRU_smoothed). I then calculate the unemployment gap (UNGAP) by taking the difference between unemployment and the smoothed TV-NAIRU. I also record the unemployment gap using the unsmoothed estimates (UNGAP_raw) just to be thorough, although I do not use them. My method for estimating the TV-NAIRU unfortunately restricts the usable period of data even further to the 1970s and onward as 13 years (52 quarters) of data between the 1960s and 1970s do not have observations for the TV-NAIRU or the unemployment gap. Below is a graph comparing the smoothed and unsmoothed TV-NAIRU values for the unemployment gap:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Smoothed vs. Unsmoothed TV-NAIRU Unemployment Gap\n\n\n\nThe smoothed unemployment gap is particularly less jagged during the labor market weirdness of the CoVid-19 pandemic which is helpful for the analysis of this paper. This (see appendix: “MODEL.R” and “GordonModelDataset.csv) is the final and complete dataset containing observations for all variables between Q4 1974 and Q2 2023 (n = 199).

The only variable not included is the relative price of imports as I simply could not find a source with observations going back far enough to be useful or worthwhile to include.\n\n\n4 The Curves\nAs noted before, the traditional curve demonstrates the relationship between the rates of inflation and unemployment. Specifically, the relationship should be an inverse one. Shown below is a graph with a traditional curve constructed by decade with quarterly data from each quarter from Q1 1960 to Q2 2023:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Traditional Phillips Curve\n\n\n\nThis representation demonstrates the central issue of the traditional curve—particularly in the 1970s—and why it is hardly even used anymore. I used data going back to the 1960s because it was available given that the traditional curve does not use the unemployment gap but rather the unemployment rate. As can be seen in the line of fit, the relationship between inflation and unemployment is not inverse over a period from the 1960s to the 2020s. If we were to zoom in on particular decades, we would see that the inverse relationship sometimes holds, but is completely upended in the 1970s—observable in seeing which decades most of the quarters of simultaneously high inflation and high unemployment are on the graph. The traditional curve is not up to the task and that is precisely why other specifications, like the accelerationist curve, have been more popular since the 1970s.\n\nThe accelerationist curve demonstrates the relationship between the change of the rate of inflation and the unemployment gap. Shown below is a graph with an accelerationist curve constructed by decade with the data from each quarter from Q4 1974 to Q2 2023:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Accelerationist Phillips Curve\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn contrast to the traditional curve, the accelerationist curve manages to maintain the inverse relationship over a period of decades. Does this mean that the accelerationist curve is a good specification? No, but it is at least a better one. To demonstrate why this alone is not sufficient, consider how the trend may look by decade. On the right is a graph of multiple accelerationist curves by decade, it is almost flat for several decades:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Accelerationist Phillips Curve by Decade\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough the accelerationist curve does do well with data from the 1970s many decades show an extremely slight inverse relationship (if at all), and the 2010s show a positive one! This is where the accelerationist curve fails. To go further, consider equation 5 from earlier. Running a regression of the unemployment gap on the change in inflation nets us the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Accelerationist Phillips Curve Model Estimates\n\n\n\nThis is not particularly bad, in fact since the actual changes in inflation swing more in both directions, the “aggregate” change within a given number of periods is not far off. The problem is that our \\(R^{2}\\) is small. A model including just the unemployment gap on the change in inflation accounts for a small percentage of variation in the change in inflation and that is clear in the graph above. To the right is the regression output using the “stargazer” package (Hlavac, 2020) for R:\n\n\n\nTable 5: Accelerationist Phillips Curve Model Regression Table\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf one were to take the predicted values for the change in inflation from the estimation of this model for a period and the lagged inflation of preceeding period, they would get something that does not look terrible on first glance, but is quickly revealedd to be little more than a lagged chart of inflation give or take the tiny estimate for the change in inflation. Put another way, they would get something that looks like a slightly tweaked AR(1) model—not especially useful for actually modelling past (and particularly future) inflation.\n\nThe traditional curve is simply not suitable for showing its desired relationship between inflation and unemployment and the accelerationist curve does not make for a good model of it over time despite at least generally maintaining the expected relationship. With the varying failures of both perhaps there is truth in the death of the curve. Robert J. Gordon though, disagrees—the problem is not that the relationship is not there, you just need to through the kitchen sink at it—and so comes the triangle model.\n\n\n5 The Mighty Trianlge (Model and Methodology)\nThe triangle model is not that radical of a change. It is like the accelerationist curve (recall how equation 5 is written) bar the fact that it includes supply shocks alongside the unemployment gap and lagged inflation (Gordon 2013). This single difference helps the model become far better at matching actual inflation with its predictions. The model used in this paper is adapted from the model used by Gordon (2013). Although that version was from a working paper, Gordon writes that the implementation is not far different from that of his 1997 paper. One significant difference between that implementation and that of this paper is the observation period. Gordon’s data (2013) goes from the 1960s to the 2010s whereas mine goes from the 1970s to the 2020s. For the Phillips curve to be dead, the relationship between inflation and unemployment would have to be a non-factor. As such, any results showing something contrary are signs of life. What matters though, is if the relationship can still be implemented such that a strong model of inflation can be constructed.\n\nThe model specified by Gordon includes the following: several lags of headline inflation (including moving averages), the unemployment gap and lags of it, the food energy effect (late period) and lags of it, the relative price of imports and lags of it, and the 8-quarter productivity trend and lags of it (Gordon 2013). I do not have data for the relative prices of imports, so the specification of the model used here is as follows:\n\\[\n\\pi_{t} = \\beta_{0}+\\beta_{1}MA\\pi_{t-1}+\\beta_{2}\\pi_{t-2}+\\beta_{3}\\pi_{t-3}+\\beta_{4}\\pi_{t-4}+\\beta_{5}MA\\pi_{t-5}\n\\] \\[\n+\\beta_{6}\\pi_{t-6}+\\beta_{7}\\pi_{t-7}+\\beta_{8}\\pi_{t-8}+\\beta_{9}MA\\pi_{t-9}+\\beta_{10}\\pi_{t-10}\n\\] \\[\n+\\beta_{11}\\pi_{t-11}+\\beta_{12}\\pi_{t-12}+\\beta_{13}MA\\pi_{t-13}+\\beta_{14}\\pi_{t-14}+\\beta_{15}\\pi_{t-15}\n\\] \\[\n+\\beta_{16}\\pi_{t-16}+\\beta_{17}MA\\pi_{t-17}+\\beta_{18}\\pi_{t-18}+\\beta_{19}\\pi_{t-19}+\\beta_{20}\\pi_{t-20}\n\\] \\[\n+\\beta_{21}MA\\pi_{t-21}+\\beta_{22}\\pi_{t-22}+\\beta_{23}\\pi_{t-23}+\\beta_{24}\\pi_{t-24}+\\beta_{25}(u_{t}-\\overline{u_{t}}) \\label{eq:model1} \\tag{6}\n\\] \\[\n+\\beta_{26}(u_{t-1}-\\overline{u_{t-1}})+\\beta_{27}(u_{t-2}-\\overline{u_{t-2}})+\\beta_{28}(u_{t-3}-\\overline{u_{t-3}})+\\beta_{29}(u_{t-4}-\\overline{u_{t-4}})+\\beta_{30}fe_{t}\n\\] \\[\n+\\beta_{31}fe_{t-1}+\\beta_{32}fe_{t-2}+\\beta_{33}fe_{t-3}+\\beta_{34}fe_{t-4}+\\beta_{35}latefe_{t}\n\\] \\[\n+\\beta_{36}latefe_{t-1}+\\beta_{37}latefe_{t-2}+\\beta_{38}latefe_{t-3}+\\beta_{39}latefe_{t-4}+\\beta_{40}prodtrend_{t-1}\n\\] \\[\n+\\beta_{41}prodtrend_{t-2}+\\beta_{42}prodtrend_{t-3}+\\beta_{43}prodtrend_{t-4}+\\beta_{44}prodtrend_{t-5}\n\\]\nThe model itself clearly has some questionable aspects. For example, although inflation is only stationary at the 10% significance level (see below Augmented Dickey-Fuller test on Headline PCE), it is still not very kosher to use inflation rather than the change in it.\n\n\n\nTable 6: Augemented Dickey-Fuller Test on Headline PCE Inflation\n\n\n\n\n\nstatistic\np.value\nparameter\nalternative\n\n\n\n\n-3.2027\n0.089\nheadline_inflation\nstationary\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, if this is good enough for Gordon, I struggle to believe that it could be completely wrong. This implementation can very fairly be described as throwing the kitchen sink at data. The thing is, that it also still does demonstrate the validity of the relationship first identified by Bill Phillips almost a century ago. After running the initial regression, I keep only the regressors that were significant (see appendix: “first_regression.png”), resulting in the final model:\n\\[\n\\pi_{t} = \\beta_{0}+\\beta_{1}MA\\pi_{t-1}+\\beta_{2}\\pi_{t-4}+\\beta_{3}MA\\pi_{t-5}+\\beta_{4}(u_{t}+\\overline{u_{t}})\n\\] \\[\n+\\beta_{5}fe_{t}+\\beta_{6}fe_{t-1}+\\beta_{7}latefe_{t}+\\beta_{8}latefe_{t-1} \\label{eq:model2} \\tag{7}\n\\]\nUsing a sample period covering Q4 1974 to Q2 2013 and equation 7, I estimate inflation from Q4 1974 to Q2 2023.\n\n\n6 Results\n\n\n\nThe results of the regression on the final model are included to the right:\n\nInterestingly, the regression on the initial model did not find the second or third lag of inflation to be significant but did find the fourth lag to be. According to the regression results an increase in the contemporaneous unemployment gap is associated with a decrease in the inflation of a given period, so the relationship between the two holds strong and is still inverse! Interestingly, although an increase in the contemporaneous food energy effect is associated with an increase in inflation, an increase in the prior period is associated with a decrease in inflation. This appears to reflect a kind of “cooling” to inflation following spikes in food or energy prices in prior quarters. It is these latter kinds of effects that the triangle model captures, and the accelerationist curve does not is\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 7: Triangle Model Regression Table\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nperhaps why the former serves as a better model of inflation overall. To illustrate this, I plot the estimates of the model, including those that are simulated (e.g., periods that were not included in the sample, Q2 2013 to Q2 2023), displayed below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Triangle Model Inflation Estimates\n\n\n\nHow could a dead curve be so accurate? While “eyeballing” is not the most advanced kind of statistical analysis, it is clear that the model does well at its purpose.\n\n\n7 Conclusion\nThe Phillips curve is not dead, it is misspecified. Even without using short-run unemployment, which is better accoridng to Gordon (2013) for modern estimates, the triangle model provides accurate estimates for inflation, including for simulated periods. In his 1977 paper, Robert J. Gordon identified cost-push inflation, supply shocks, as a necessary component of any model trying to account for the stagflation of the 1970s and clearly he was on to something. Since then, he has updated his model every decade short of 2020. This is not a radical model, is it a better specification of a relationship identified 20 years earlier and it has been available for over half a century. To say the Phillips curve is dead is to ignore this and other attempts to better specify the relationship—consider even a non-linear curve or one based in conflict theory.\n\nThis paper took the triangle model as specified by Gordon (2013) and updated it with more recent data. The results of this paper are in alignment with those of the former, finding that the triangle model is a strong method for modelling inflation and that by extension, the relationship first identified in the traditional curve must still hold some value. The major findings of this paper are that the unemployment gap and food energy effect are still significantly related to the inflation rate a decade on.\n\nThe traditional curve is dead—long live the traditional curve—and the accelerationist curve is insufficient, but that does not mean that the relationship is not there or cannot still be considered in policy decisions. Instead, we just have to add in additional factors to account for supply shocks, as Gordon et al. (1977);Gordon (1981);Gordon (1997);Gordon (2013) does. Look no further than Jerome Powell’s attempts to increase unemployment to decrease inflation this very year. I doubt the Federal Reserve would be relying so much on a “dead” idea.\n\n\n8 References\n\n\nGordon, Robert J. 1968. “The Role of Monetary Policy.” American Economic Review 58 (3): 1–17. https://login.ezproxy.uvm.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/role-monetary-policy/docview/59405489/se-2.\n\n\n———. 1981. “Inflation, Flexible Exchange Rates, and the Natural Rate of Unemployment.” https://doi.org/10.3386/w0708.\n\n\n———. 1997. “The Time-Varying NAIRU and Its Implications for Economic Policy.” Journal of Economic Perspectives 11 (1): 11–32. https://doi.org/10.1257/jep.11.1.11.\n\n\n———. 2013. “The Phillips Curve Is Alive and Well: Inflation and the NAIRU During the Slow Recovery.” https://doi.org/10.3386/w19390.\n\n\nGordon, Robert J., George Perry, Franco Modigliani, Arthur Okun, Michael Wachter, Pentti Kouri, Edmund Phelps, and Christopher Sims. 1977. “Can the Inflation of the 1970s Be Explained?” Brookings Papers on Economic Activity 1977 (1): 253. https://doi.org/10.2307/2534262.\n\n\nStaiger, Douglas, James H Stock, and Mark W Watson. 1997. “The NAIRU, Unemployment and Monetary Policy.” Journal of Economic Perspectives 11 (1): 33–49. https://doi.org/10.1257/jep.11.1.33.\n\n\n\n\n9 Appendix\nDATA.R\nMODEL.R\nDataCleaned.csv\nDataComplete.csv\nGordonModelDataset.csv\nFirst_regression.png"

    "text": "1.1 Why Brexit?\nThe UK was one of the principal members of the EU by size and economic power. In the same class were only France, Germany, and perhaps Italy. Among these members—specifically among France and Germany—the UK was long least committed to the European project. The reasons for this vary but, as aptly summarized by writers Henley, Rankin, and O’Carroll for The Guardian:\n\n[Britain has] a profound sense of exceptionalism, reinforced by relative economic success and an overwhelmingly Eurosceptic popular press […] This eventually combined to create the impression that the EU was essentially an anti-British plot […] Amid the bitter fallout of the financial crash, mounting public concern over immigration and a political threat from the right in the form of Nigel Farage’s anti-EU [UKIP] party led David Cameron to promise an in-out Brexit referendum if he won the 2015 election. A largely populist, emotive, and evidence-free campaign with the inspired slogan “Take back control” carried the day, with voters motivated by a wide range of factors opting by 52% to 48% in [favor] of the UK leaving the EU.\n-Henley, Rankin, and O’Carroll (2020)\n\nThis is a familiar narrative for Americans. Following the 2008 financial crisis, right-wing populists gained a foothold in mainstream conversations. In the UK this growth of the populist right put the Conservative Cameron government in the understandably difficult position of doing something it may not have necessarily wanted to do but did in the hope of appealing to a growing voting segment. Understanding all the individual motivations for Brexit is not paramount to understanding its economic implications, but it is useful to have an idea of who was in charge when this happened."

    "section": "1.2 Economic Implications",
    "text": "1.2 Economic Implications\nAlthough the UK left the EU in February 2020, there was a transition period lasting until the end of the same year wherein the former remained within the common market. This means that analyses of the economic effects of Brexit really must begin in January 2021, after the transition period. There are two principal things I wish to consider in terms of changes to the British economy following Brexit—the labor market, and price levels.\n\n1.2.1 Labor\nGiven the limited restrictions on intra-EU travel, and the relatively higher earnings in the UK when compared to some other member states the Isles had in fact long-benefited from EU migration currents. The UK did at the EU level what the US does at a global level—absorb foreign labor looking for higher wages1. The severing of this connection created a new shortfall in labor, one that certainly was not appreciated when, a mere month later, pandemic restrictions were put into place. According to the Centre for European Reform, by June 2022 “[…] there was a significant shortfall of around \\(460000\\) EU-origin workers, partly but not wholly compensated for by an increase of about \\(130000\\) non-EU workers” (Springford and Ports 2023). In other words, only a little more than a year after the end of the transition period, \\(300000\\) people who would have been in the UK and would have contributed their labor supply, were not there. The UK Office for National Statistics reports the employment level as over \\(30\\) million persons (Powell and Francis-Devine 2024), but that does not mean that this change is a drop in the bucket. Consider labor levels and growth as stocks and flows. Yes, the stock of labor within the UK is large now, but just as capital depreciates, individuals leave the labor force and must be replaced by inflows of new labor. The flow of labor to the UK was down by over \\(300000\\) persons the year after the Brexit transition ended.\n\nOne way to observe changes in labor market conditions is by simply looking at the unemployment rates. Declining unemployment indicates a tightening—relative to the prior period—labor market. Below is a graph of unemployment rates among the UK, France, Germany, Italy, and the EU average:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Rates\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Gaps\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Unemployment\n\n\n\nThe shaded region in Figure 1 (a) represents the period from when pandemic lockdown restrictions in the UK were first implemented to when they were last lifted. This period is generally similar in many other European countries in terms of the timeline of restrictions. The dashed vertical lines represent, from left to right, the initial Brexit announcement and the end of the transition period. As can be seen, the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic led to large fluctuations in unemployment but, zooming in on the UK we still notice two things. First, the initial stage of Brexit (February 2020) had minimal impact—a slight uptick in unemployment was recorded following that change and quickly flattened at the beginning of the pandemic. This negligible result is understandable given that the UK still remained within the common market and travel area during this initial stage until the end of the transition period. Second, immediately following the end of the transition period there is a drop in unemployment—albeit also very slight—followed by a more sustained drop thereafter mirroring all other groups with the adjustment to the pandemic era. This second change is slightly more significant as, in all other countries (including the EU average), unemployment either remained at parity with or slightly rose when compared to the preceding period. Whatever the case, it is clear that the early effects of Brexit are somewhat buried by the pandemic.\n\nOne problem with using the unemployment rate is that—alone—it does not indicate if a labor market is tight but only if it is tightening, as noted previously. This is because the constitutions of labor markets vary by place. A low unemployment rate in one region is not necessarily low in another. Instead, it is useful to assess labor market conditions across regions according to their respective “natural” rates. From this, we derive the unemployment gap. This indicator is the rate of unemployment, \\(U\\), less the natural rate of unemployment (NAIRU), \\(\\overline{U}\\), and it allows us to better assess the changes in labor markets in terms of their respective equilibrium levels of unemployment:\n\\[\n\\ddot{u} = u - \\overline{u} \\label{eq:eq_1} \\tag{1}\n\\]\nThe NAIRU can vary by country and through time, and the method for estimating the time-varying natural rate of unemployment (TV-NAIRU) is described later in Section 3.2.1. Looking at the unemployment gap, a very similar story emerges. The shaded region in Figure 1 (b) represents the period from when pandemic lockdown restrictions in the UK were first implemented to when they were last lifted. The unemployment gap fell in the UK in the period immediately following the end of the transition period. Needless to say, there is something different about the composition of the UK labor market following its exit from the common market and travel area.\n\nThe effects of the pandemic on labor markets were complicated, and it is clear that labor tightening occurred just about everywhere during the pandemic recovery, but it is also clear the UK had a uniquely sharp and sustained tightening.\n\n\n1.2.2 Prices\nAlongside changes to the labor market was an inflation spike that rocked the UK in the latter half of 2021. While inflation, like labor tightening, struck all included, it is worth investigating the role of Brexit. Below is a series of figures detailing inflation across the five entities of interest:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Headline\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Core\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) Energy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(d) Food\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Inflation\n\n\n\n\nAs seen in Figure 2, while the addition of food-energy inflation results in a less eye-catching display, the absence of those two price-shocks in Figure 2 (b) shows inflation in to be higher in the UK than all but the EU average past mid-2021. Adam Posen, a former Monetary Policy Committee member at the Bank of England, and Lucas Rengifo-Keller attribute this to Brexit, writing:\n\nBy ending the free movement of EU migrant workers to the UK, the UK government has unilaterally cut the labor supply and its elasticity. By adding new tariff and nontariff trade barriers, the British government has slashed purchasing power and available imports, and it has created inflation during the staggered implementation of the Brexit deal.\n-Posen and Rengifo-Keller (2016)\n\nWith the exit from the common market, the UK faced higher barriers to trade with its continental neighbors than before. It reasons that higher costs would incur higher price levels. It similarly reasons to say that energy inflation resulted from the onset of the Russo-Ukrainian war and thus was more damaging to continental importers—the timelines match up fairly well. Additionally, the tightening of the labor market outlined in Section 1.2.1 likely resulted in wage inflation, which, as Posen and Rengifo-Keller (2016) pointed out: was higher than in France and Germany.\n\nUpon review of labor and prices in the UK during this period, it is clear that Brexit had an effect, albeit one that is obfuscated by the pandemic. Now two questions remain. First, can a traditional model of inflation still accurately fit the huge shocks of this period? Second, what specifically was most structurally affected by these two things in terms of labor and prices, and can it account for the difference?"

This curve was broadened to describe the relationship between inflation and unemployment when they are inversely related. This simple curve proved to be a somewhat useful, imperfect, guide for macroeconomic policy. However, in the 1970s something strange happened.\n\nThe 1970s saw a period of stagflation—high unemployment and inflation—in the United States, signaling that the relationship identified by Phillips was not so ironclad."

    "section": "2.2 Gordon’s Triangle",
    "text": "2.2 Gordon’s Triangle\nResponding to the stagflation of the 1970s, Robert J. Gordon developed a model of inflation that described overall inflation as the result of three forces: inertia, demand, and supply Inertia represents so-called underlying inflation, which amounts in model implementations to lags of the rate of inflation. Demand reflects an “[…] index of excess demand” (Gordon 1997), which is labor market tightness. Lastly, supply concerns price shocks like food or energy inflation. Inertia and supply merely require other rates of inflation, but demand requires a measure of labor market tightness. While the unemployment rate may appear an appealing choice, as noted in Section 1.2.1, there are problems with using it to gauge this tightness. Instead, it is more useful to again focus on the unemployment gap seen in Equation \\(\\eqref{eq:eq_1}\\).\n\nThe unemployment gap allows us to better assess the changes in labor markets in terms of their respective equilibrium levels of unemployment. However, its estimation also requires an estimation of the natural rate, which will be seen in Section 3.2.1.\nIn his 2013 working paper, Gordon uses the model to assess the continued presence of the Phillips curve relationship in modeling inflation by taking data over a period of decades and observing how the model responds, concluding that—at least as of then—the relationship continued to exist (Gordon 2013), and that his model remains robust.\n\nI follow a variation of this model, and again aim to demonstrate its robustness, however I aim to do so across a different time period including perhaps even greater variation in the indicators used in the regression."

While unemployment increased during the pandemic period, the authors project it to decrease and follow that trend in the years to come, which, in addition to research by Springford and Ports (2023), may reflect labor market tightness attributable to a post-Brexit immigration environment in the United Kingdom.\n\nKnowing already that these are the likely effects of Brexit given this work and the analysis in Section 1.2, I intend rather to investigate if the Gordon model described above in Section 2.2 can adequately account for these changes and what specific structural change—if any—is most responsible for the changes to the British economy in this period."

In this study, the treatment is European Union membership and the institutional reforms associated with membership. The authors find that joining the European Union and making the required sociopolitical adjustments resulted in lower inflation and higher unemployment in Lithuania when compared to Belarus—a country that is not a member of the European Union (as of 2024 at least). While a comparison between these two states is not very comparable to larger economies like that of the United Kingdom, this finding is significant because it demonstrates the kinds of changes to expect for a nation joining the EU, thus conversely illustrating what to expect for a nation leaving that union.\n\nGylfason and Hochreiter (2022) use different models than I do but remains in line with the results I expect later in Section 4 and what was seen in Section 2.3—not being in the EU means higher inflation and a tighter labor market."

    "section": "3.1 Data and Methodology",
    "text": "3.1 Data and Methodology\nAll data is sourced from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), with monthly time series observations from January 2007 to June 2023 for 26 groups at the national level. I collect data on as many EU (or in the case of the UK, former EU) members as are available from the OECD alongside the EU member-state average—although I do not use this average in my models. Headline, core, food, and energy inflation are all from “Inflation (CPI)” (2017). Unemployment rates are from “Harmonised Unemployment Rate (HUR)” (2017). All data cleaning and modeling is done in R.\n\nAll data is measured as percent rates, with inflation being the percent change in consumer price levels between years and unemployment being the proportion of persons in the labor force but not working within a given country. To identify Brexit and the pandemic, I create dummy variables \\(\\text{BREXITnumeric}\\) and \\(\\text{COVIDnumeric}\\) respectively. Additionally, I create a third dummy to identify the UK exclusively among other countries, \\(\\text{isUKnumeric}\\). The conditions for the three dummies are as follows (in the order that they were presented):\n\nBefore January 2021 \\(\\text{BREXITnumeric}=0\\), after \\(\\text{BREXITnumeric}=1\\). I choose January 2021 because that is the date of the end of the transition period, officially ending the association of the UK as part of the EU common market.\nBefore March 2020 or after February 2022 \\(\\text{COVIDnumeric}=0\\), otherwise \\(\\text{COVIDnumeric}=1\\). I chose March 2020 and February 2022 because those are the dates of the first and last lockdowns in the UK—which I use to demarcate the pandemic era for all countries studied since these periods were generally similar across Europe.\nIf a country in the dataset is not the UK \\(\\text{isUKnumeric}=0\\), otherwise \\(\\text{isUKnumeric}=1\\).\n\nAll groups studied are treated with the Brexit dummy but only the UK ever has \\(text{is_UK_numeric}=1\\), and I have observations for all groups before, during, and after the pandemic and for before and after Brexit. The total number of observations for this period is 5148, meaning that there are 198 observations per entity.\n\nTo answer my questions of interest I will implement a variation of the Gordon model using the data described above. To do this I will need to also estimate a TV-NAIRU, which unfortunately cuts down the period of usable data to December 2015 to October 2022. This is further explained in the next section Section 3.2.1. The table below shows the final list of variables for all groups over a period from December 2015 to October 2022:\n\nVariables\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\\(C\\pi\\)\nCore Inflation\n\n\n\\(E\\pi\\)\nEnergy Inflation\n\n\n\\(F\\pi\\)\nFood Inflation\n\n\n\\(H\\pi\\)\nHeadline Inflation\n\n\n\\(\\overline{H\\pi}\\)\nHeadline Inflation Moving Average\n\n\n\\(u\\)\nUnemployment Rate\n\n\n\\(\\overline{u}\\)\nNatural Rate of Unemployment\n\n\n\\(\\ddot{u}\\)\nUnemployment Gap\n\n\n\\(\\text{BREXITnumeric}\\)\nConditional dummy for Brexit treatment\n\n\n\\(\\text{COVIDnumeric}\\)\nConditional dummy for pandemic time period\n\n\n\\(\\text{isUKnumeric}\\)\nConditional dummy for if a country in the dataset is the United Kingdom\n\n\n\nAdditionally, I do not include the EU average in my NAIRU estimates as it would be redundant given how many EU member states I already have included. In all, I end with \\(25\\) countries, and \\(2075\\) observations—\\(83\\) observations per country—so things should be fine in terms of data.\n\nTo test the robustness of the Gordon model, I will construct a simple variation of it and calibrate it with data up to February 2020—before Brexit and the pandemic lockdowns. I will then feed it all the data I have available, resulting in a fitted line for data before February 2020, and a simulated line for the period thereafter. For the structural changes I will construct a naive country-based fixed-effects model and feed it the model all available data (how else would the Brexit and pandemic dummy variables work) and check for significant interaction terms. I will then add individual or like pairs of regressors from the Gordon model as if they were controls to see if their presence upends the significance of those interaction terms. Each control that does such will be recorded."

    "section": "3.2 Model(s)",
    "text": "3.2 Model(s)\n\n3.2.1 Estimating the TV-NAIRU\nTo estimate a TV-NAIRU Gordon (1997) follows the methodology of Staiger, Stock, and Watson (1997), which involves regressing lags of the unemployment rate rate on the change in core inflation and dividing the intercept by the coefficients on the lagged regressors. From Staiger, Stock, and Watson (1997), consider a quarterly model wherein core inflation is regressed on four lags of the unemployment rate:\n\\[\nC\\pi_{t} = \\beta_{0}+\\beta_{1}u_{t-1}+\\beta_{2}u_{t-2}+\\beta_{3}u_{t-3}+\\beta_{4}u_{t-4} \\label{eq:eq_NAIRU1} \\tag{2}\n\\]\nFrom Equation \\(\\eqref{eq:eq_NAIRU1}\\) the NAIRU would be derived by:\n\\[\n\\overline{u} = \\frac{\\beta_{0}}{\\beta_{1}+\\beta_{2}+\\beta_{3}+\\beta_{4}} \\label{eq:eq_NAIRU2} \\tag{3}\n\\]\nFour lags of unemployment are used for quarterly data in Staiger, Stock, and Watson (1997), so I use twelve for monthly data:\n\\[\n\\overline{u} = \\frac{\\beta_{0}}{\\beta_{1}+\\beta_{2}+\\beta_{3}+\\beta_{4}+\\beta_{5}+\\beta_{6}+\\beta_{7}+\\beta_{8}+\\beta_{9}+\\beta_{10}+\\beta_{11}+\\beta_{12}} \\label{eq:eq_NAIRU3} \\tag{4}\n\\]\nStaiger, Stock, and Watson (1997) go on to use a complex cubic spline, so instead I just run a rolling regression and smooth it with a Hodrick-Prescott filter set to \\(\\lambda = 14400\\). This rolling average regression method results in some observations being lost due to the window of observations per average. The window needs to be sufficiently large while also leaving room for the average to change. I use a window period of \\(99\\) which evenly divides the total dataset, but unfortunately still leads to the first years being lost as the first \\(99\\) periods per entity are averaged for the first step of the rolling average. Additionally, once I have the TV-NAIRU estimates, I shift the estimates down to match with other variable observations per month. This results in the last few months being lost. Still, I have over \\(2000\\) observations for \\(25\\) countries as noted in Section 3.1.\n\n\n3.2.2 Gordon’s Triangle\nNow armed with a TV-NAIRU estimate for each country, the triangle can be implemented. For my implementation of the model, I follow a reduced version of Gordon (2013). In that paper, Gordon essentially throws the kitchen sink at the problem: inflation is lagged \\(24\\) times, with moving averages interspersed every \\(4\\) lags, and all other variables are similarly lagged at least \\(4\\) times each. This was for quarterly data, if I were to replicate this method for monthly data I would have \\(72\\) lags of inflation alone—I am not doing. Rather, I choose to focus on a much narrower set of lags. For my implementation, I lag inflation \\(3\\) times, with the first (\\(1\\) month) and last lag (\\(13\\) months) being a moving average like in Gordon (2013). All other variables include \\(1\\) lag alongside a contemporaneous (unlagged) observation.

It is called naive because it is just a country-based fixed effects model with dummies for Brexit and the pandemic. The model is constructed as follows:\n\\[\n\\scriptsize H\\pi_{n}= \\beta_{0}+\\beta_{1}Country+\\beta_{2}\\text{COVIDnumeric}+\\beta_{3}\\text{isUKnumeric} \\times \\text{COVIDnumeric} +\n\\] \\[\n\\scriptsize \\beta_{4}\\text{BREXITnumeric}+\\beta_{5}\\text{isUKnumeric} \\times \\text{BREXITnumeric}+\n\\] \\[\n\\scriptsize \\beta_{6}\\text{BREXITnumeric} \\times \\text{COVIDnumeric}+\n\\] \\[\n\\scriptsize \\beta_{7}\\text{isUKnumeric} \\times \\text{BREXITnumeric} \\times \\text{COVIDnumeric} \\label{eq:eq_naive} \\tag{6}\n\\]\nThe interaction terms detail the effect of Brexit and the pandemic on the UK in particular. Individual or like pairs of regressors from Equation \\(\\eqref{eq:eq_Gordon}\\) are added to Equation \\(\\eqref{eq:eq_naive}\\) to assess the structural effects of Brexit and the pandemic. An example of such an addition is:\n\\[\n\\scriptsize H\\pi_{n}= \\alpha_{0}\\ddot{u}_{n} + \\alpha_{1}\\ddot{u}_{n-1} +\n\\] \\[\n\\scriptsize \\beta_{0}+\\beta_{1}Country+\\beta_{2}\\text{COVIDnumeric}+\\beta_{3}\\text{isUKnumeric} \\times \\text{COVIDnumeric}+\n\\] \\[\n\\scriptsize \\beta_{4}\\text{BREXITnumeric}+\\beta_{5}\\text{isUKnumeric} \\times \\text{BREXITnumeric}+\n\\] \\[\n\\scriptsize \\beta_{6}\\text{BREXITnumeric} \\times \\text{COVIDnumeric}+\n\\] \\[\n\\scriptsize \\beta_{7}\\text{isUKnumeric} \\times \\text{BREXITnumeric} \\times \\text{COVIDnumeric} \\label{eq:eq_naive1} \\tag{7}\n\\]\nIn the above example, the contemporaneous and lagged unemployment gaps are added."

The fact that the contemporaneous and lagged unemployment gap cancel each other other implies that as well. Lastly, this may be a flaw in my TV-NAIRU estimation method, as the TV-NAIRUs for each of the countries included varies significantly. In the case of the UK, it is known that their core inflation shot past continental Europe during the pandemic recovery. Given that the TV-NAIRU is estimated by a regression on core inflation, such changes should be kept in mind when looking at the results of the unemployment gap. Whatever the case, the model clearly does well, explaining about \\(92.4\\%\\) of the variation in headline inflation and doing so without even having to throw one hundred regressors at it. Moreover, the signs of the coefficients are in line with previous works (Gordon et al. 1977; Gordon 1981, 1997, 2013). The results show that food price shocks in particular had a large (almost \\(0.2\\) point) impact on headline inflation. The figure below further demonstrates the strength of the model:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Gordon Model\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough “eyeballing it” is not the most surefire method of checking for result validity, I struggle to think that a model that produces such a figure as is seen above would be poor at estimating inflation. There is a slight overestimation near the tail-end though, which is worthy of note and is in fact related to the results of my second question in Section 4.2, where it is further explained."

All regressors return significant coefficients. In particular, \\(brexitnumeric\\), the triple interaction, and the intercept are the only positive coefficients (excluding country-based fixed-effects where there is variation among countries). This implies that the pandemic had a deflationary effect while Brexit had an inflationary one.\n\nIncluding a table per adjusted variable would manifest as a bunch of extremely long tables and another \\(10\\) pages. In short, with \\(MA\\pi_{n-1}\\) the triple interaction is no longer significant but the others are. With \\(\\pi_{n-2}\\) and \\(MA\\pi_{n-13}\\) all are still significant. With all three paired the result is the same as with \\(MA\\pi_{n-1}\\) alone. With \\(E\\pi_{n}\\) or \\(E\\pi_{n-1}\\) or the two paired together all are still significant. With \\(F\\pi_{n}\\) only the UK-Brexit interaction term remains significant. With \\(F\\pi_{n-1}\\) all remain significant. With the two paired the result is the same as with just \\(F\\pi_{n}\\). With \\(\\ddot{u}_{n}\\) or \\(\\ddot{u}_{n-1}\\) or the two paired together all are still significant. Whatever the change (other than the unemployment gap), any added regressor is significant. It is clear then that while the changes of Brexit specifically in the UK outside of the pandemic era remain unexplained by these individual controls, including food price inflation explains much of the variation during the pandemic in the UK. The figure below illustrates the difference between the initial naive model estimation and the same model after contemporaneous food inflation and its one-period lag are added:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Initial\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Model with Food Inflation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Naive Model Comparison\n\n\n\nFirst of all, it is clear from Figure 4 that even just including food inflation drastically improves the model. Second, something that may be fairly noticeable in Figure 4 (b) is that the predicted value of inflation again begins to overshoot near the end of the observational period. This is the same as what happened earlier in Section 4.1! While it would of course be preferred that the Gordon model in Figure 3 did not see this, its presence here is instead rather welcome, illustrating the role that food price level inflation may be playing in overestimating inflation in the Gordon model for that period. In the case of Figure 3, I would wager that inertia is not fully accounted for in that period as it is so close to the end of the observational period—were there more observations, the estimation would eventually return following the path of actual reports of inflation. Either way, these results show that through Brexit and the pandemic arose a structural change in the British economy around food pricing—rather than Brexit and the pandemic increasing inflation by their own existence—and this change underlies a notable portion of inflation in the UK during this period."

    "text": "🏡    Resume\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 Something Isn’t Right\n There has been a lot in the news about “recession” recently and, considering current data, it does not make much sense.  While wages went up (“Employment Cost Index” 2022) and comparatively decent jobs remain available, half the country seems to think that we are back in 2008. Hell, unemployment is back to pre-pandemic levels (“Employment Situation Summary” 2022), with long-term unemployment (27 weeks or more) falling as well, and the federal funds rate, while rising steeply, just hit what it was around this same time in 2019 (“Federal Funds Target Range - Upper Limit” 2022) It is not like nothing is going on, though, something must be off for people to be so concerned, so what is it? Prices. That is it, or a lot of it. The confluence of ongoing supply chain issues, a war in one of the most vital exporting countries in the grain market (“Even With a Ukraine Deal, World Grain Supplies Are Tight” 2023) instigated by an important export country in the natural gas market, greed, and yes, to an extent the rapid expansion of the money supply from government assistance during the pandemic has worked out to a sharp rise in prices across the board. Is this concerning? Absolutely. Is this a recession? No. So why do I keep hearing the word?\n\n\n2 Ignoring the Data\nIn 2020 a global pandemic threw the global economy for a loop. Industries whose work could not easily be transferred online declined and millions of people were suddenly unemployed, and no one was sure when exactly things would end. Two years later and the pandemic is still close to us. Some of those millions who were unemployed, and many others, are dead now. But one could be forgiven for mistaking that things had passed with how little care many seem to have anymore. This general sense of apathy, or at least conscious ignorance, has grown so bad in fact that there is already some whole new pandemic and I have yet to hear a single real person share much concern over it. No one wants to care about anymore, and the governments of the world—which had at one time thrown enormous sums of money into the void which constituted their pandemic economies—have just as quickly dropped all mandates and shoved everyone back to the workplace. On one hand this makes sense, there is a feeling that prior to the pandemic things made some kind of sense and that organizations should return to their state of being. On the other hand, over one million people have died, just in the United States, and many are still dying, and no matter how much we choose to ignore it, things are not just going to become normal.\nBut what does any of that have to do with our present recessionary woes? A great deal, actually.\nThe trouble with selectively detaching yourself from the realities before you is that it becomes hard to keep up with everything else. While national economies are no strangers to emotion—look no further than the intense volatility of some stocks to see how impactful feelings can be—the degree to which many are now just going with their guts on this whole thing is almost unprecedented. The stubbornness with which we continue to ignore the presence of a deadly pandemic has made its way into how we think about a great many things. In this case then, “recession” has taken on a whole new meaning, realistically becoming a buzzword for “things are bad and I don’t like it,” or, more appropriately the current “bad vibes.” This situation is articulated well by Felix Salmon and Elizabeth Spiers in a recent episode of the podcast (“Bad Vibes Economics” 2022);\n[Elizabeth Spiers] “I think people conflate their sense of financial security with a sense of overall stability and security in general. So if there is a lot of chaos happening in the world, they will automatically sort of assume that this is affecting them economically, even though it might not be the case.”\nGranted many are hit hard by soaring prices for goods but the point stands. A lot is happening, we have gone over this, and emotional overload is both very real and very reasonable given the state of affairs in the past few years but even still what could convince people that things are so unstable? One example could be the rollback of government programs as we reenter our faux normalcy, but the fact is that many of those programs worked in service of businesses more than individual people, at least directly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3 But the Markets!\nNowhere do we see the presence of this “bad vibes” mentality more than in the stock market, the beating heart of volatility, and more importantly, something often conflated with economic health and well-being. As Felix Salmon says, “The stock market. Your stocks are down. Used to feel wealthy because stocks were up high and rising. Now you feel poor because stocks are lower and falling.” It really is a perfect kind of storm. For many years there has been this beating of the drum to instill the idea that the market and the economy are linked, and to be fair, it is not so much that they are not as it is that that is not the whole story. But nevertheless, people look towards this mythical thing for answers and right now it is not giving particularly good ones. At the same time people are again going with their guts and so there is a combination of feeling bad and then hearing dreadful things from one of the main places you look. This is not to mention how much big words catch headlines so I cannot help but side-eye publishers and agencies for opining the end of prosperity for clicks. The market was also just performing phenomenally while millions were unemployed and starving so again, it is not really reflective of how things are doing.\n\n\n4 The Near Future\nOne of the most worrying things about this whole situation though is that, at the end of everything, economic health is genuinely dependent on our deeply personal faith in how things are going. When people lose faith, as many are, that’s when things start to go wrong fast. It is a tough situation because there are significant issues right now facing us down economically—the number of people presently unhoused is growing and rising costs certainly are not helping (“Inflation Is Making Homelessness Worse” 2022), and the minimum wage is nowhere near when it needs to be—and they are only magnified by the kind of fear that comes with words like recession. Luckily, the “vibe” has not yet soured enough for people to stop spending, which means that things might just work out if we can get inflation under control.\n\n\n“Bad Vibes Economics.” 2022.

Further, while external drives are typically cheaper for a bunch of supply reasons, they too were shockingly cheap.

    "text": "1.1 The Political Economies of Post-War Europe\nApproximately eight decades ago, British Conservative Party Prime Minister Winston Churchill—a man who had, among some admittedly less savory things, boldly steered his nation through the harsh and unforgiving tides of war—was ousted, by Labor Party leader Clement Attlee, in a landslide. This is one of the most stunning losses for the Conservative Party in the history of British parliamentary democracy—the British electorate wanted reform, and they voted for it. It was during the Attlee government, for instance, that the National Health Service (NHS), the national public healthcare system still in effect today, was established. Europe in the early post-war days was marked broadly by both a need to rebuild (Meurs et al. 2018b) and rising political aspirations to rebuild anew.\nA key component of these aspirations, was a wave of “internationalism” calling for cross-state peace and cooperation. This was not a phenomenon unique to post-war Europe following the Second World War, but a rather common occurrence—Count Claude-Henri de Rouvroy of Saint-Simon had drawn up an idea for a united Europe “[…] on the eve of the Congress of Vienna” (Meurs et al. 2018b). What is notable, is that this was a wave of particularly acute strength. Per Meurs et al. (2018b):\n\nIn the early post-war years, ideas about federalist cooperation and strengthening the community of European states existed alongside even more ambitious prospects, such as so-called ‘world federalism’ […] To their [European federalists’] mind, the power of the nation states had to be broken. That process would politically integrate post-war Germany (the anticipated economic engine of Western Europe) without it having to be curtailed economically for fear of renewed German military aggression.\n\nAlthough the notion of “world federalism” was ossified by the encroaching Cold War status quo, the European-level cause was bolstered in Western (and partly, Central) Europe, by fears of Soviet aggression. Moreover, there remained the strong economic incentives to rebuild via integration. Per Meurs et al. (2018b) once more:\n\nAfter the war, the economies of European countries had to be rebuild [sic] once again. Just as in the 1930s, economies in Western European countries were heavily closed off to one another as a result of tariff barriers and other national protectionist measures. An even more urgent foreign trade problem for Western European countries was a shortage of dollars, caused by an increased demand for imports from America after the elimination of Germany as a capital goods supplier. This hindered exports for the United States. The government of the United States was willing to help, but insisted on European economic integration, a precondition for efficiency in production and, therefore, rising prosperity. Last, but not least, integration would facilitate American exports to Europe.\n\nThere was both a spirit—a plea—for peace on human grounds, and an economic need for cooperation post-war."

    "section": "1.2 The European Union",
    "text": "1.2 The European Union\nApproximately seven decades ago, those post-war aspirations in Western (and Central) Europe were channeled into the reformation of the Anglo-French alliance into the “Western European Union” with an update to the Brussels Treaty (“BRUSSELS TREATY” 1994), which was itself soon thereafter joined by a series of “European Communities.” The former treaty was largely to do with military defense, but spares no time indulging readers in lovely internationalist rhetoric2.\nYet, by the time of the latter—by the time the European Communities were being established—the rosiest of this language had already waned. The federalist dream was surely done-in by the simple reality that nation states valued their autonomy, and even functionalism (“[…] a method to effect unity in a stealthy manner” via technocratic “sectoral integration” (Meurs et al. 2018b)) was bleeding. The common market was there—in the Communities—but little else. In truth, the European integrative project was already less of a cohesive bloc than the early dreams. Rather, what was left was a move to expand the functions of their existing economic cooperation (Meurs et al. 2018a):\n\nThe ECSC [European Coal and Steel Community] and the Treaties of Rome marked both a farewell to ambitions of idealistic Europeanism that had encompassed the Council of Europe, and the rise of a functionalistic, technocratic Europe. The Treaty of Maastricht was the definitive breakthrough to a ‘political’ Europe. For a long time the European Community had limited itself to its common market. The Treaty of Maastricht introduced new policy areas, such as the founding elements for a common currency, a domestic policy and a foreign and security policy […] the most important European leaders were deeply aware of the necessity of further cooperation in these years.\n\nIn other words, the core economic incentives for cooperation still rang loud, but the speed with which dreams of “world federalism” devolved into the above-described resolution, should be telling of just how consistently-applied things are within the EU. To summarize: do not mistake “Union” to mean that all states derive even stakes. Some states, for example, receive block grants for development of infrastructure funded by other states. The states who today receive such grants (our friend Poland among them) may one day be issuing them—in which case, the economic effects that we observe may be quite different."

    "section": "2.1 Prior Studies Concerning European Union Admission",
    "text": "2.1 Prior Studies Concerning European Union Admission\nThis section will detail works Gylfason and Hochreiter (2022) by economists Thorvaldur Gylfason and Eduard Hochreiter, who have together penned a series of articles comparing post-Soviet (and/or post-Yugoslav) states who joined, or did not join, the EU. In their 2009 article (Gylfason and Hochreiter 2009), published in the European Journal of Political Economy, Gylfason and Hochreiter compare the development of two states: Estonia and Georgia. Both post-Soviet states, the latter has not joined the EU and was caught in a brutal civil war in its early years (1991 to 1993), while the former joined in 2004. The authors observe the divergences between the states through time (up to the year 2006), by applying a constant-returns-to-scale growth accounting model, and by directly contrasting macroeconomic datapoints among the two. In particular, Gylfason and Hochreiter stress the political-economic development of Estonia, compared to Georgia, in the form of the “EU perspective,” or as they (Gylfason and Hochreiter 2009) aptly summarize in their introduction:\n\nWe believe that the prospect of rapid EU integration, “the EU perspective,” provided a critical anchor for sustained political, institutional, and economic reforms across the political spectrum.\nWithin less than 15 years, Estonia was able to accede to the EU and its gross national income (GNI) per capita rose to a half of that of Finland […]\nIn contrast, Georgia, after regaining independence, was torn by civil war […] Georgia was caught in a low-income trap, and suffered from corruption as well as from weak economic and institutional reforms. The absence of an EU perspective in Georgia as well as of a calm relationship with Russia did not help.\n\nIn this work, the authors conclude that a core aspect of the successful development of these (post-Soviet) EU join-ers—or at least, Estonia—is the set of institutional reforms (political, economic, etc.) implemented as part of the ascension process, which pay dividends in the long-term, alongside the benefits of membership itself. Beginning as a relatively poorer state, Estonia has out-paced Georgia because of its reforms. Trade liberalization, competition, and getting inflation under control—these are the things Estonia did on its journey towards EU membership that Georgia has not seen nearly as much success in (Gylfason and Hochreiter 2009).\nIn their 2022 article (Gylfason and Hochreiter 2022), published in the journal of Comparative Economic Studies, authors Gylfason and Hochreiter continue with the bilateral comparisons to another post-Soviet pairing: Belarus and Lithuania. The former was (and is) a state that has not joined the EU, and remains deeply politically tied to the Russian Federation3. The latter, is a post-Soviet republic that—like Estonia—joined the EU in 2004. The authors similarly compare the two states directly, again using a “simple growth accounting model” (Gylfason and Hochreiter 2022)—observing outcomes—but do so over a longer time-frame (up to 2020) and observing conditions in terms of trade-offs. Specifically, Gylfason and Hochreiter find that the types of institutional reforms implemented in Lithuania as part of ascension (as like those implemented in Estonia), saw lower inflation (getting inflation under control) as being complemented by higher unemployment when compared to Belarus. It is lovely to imagine some kind of Phillips curve is in here somewhere4, but the authors resolve to largely confirm their findings from their 2009 paper (Gylfason and Hochreiter 2009).\nIn summary, across their works comparing post-Soviet states, authors Gylfason and Hochreiter find, indeed, that joining the EU, and the process of joining, and the associated institutional reforms, contribute greatly to the differential in growth between states that join and states that do not. Getting into the EU, is a path to growth for states5, even if—per Section 1.2—we understand that such gains may not be evenly distributed long term. The knowledge that institutional reforms on the road to EU membership are a component of the economic differential however, is something that we will have to reckon with in our own analysis. Additionally, these concern differences among countries who join and do not, whereas we are looking, largely (see: @sec-did in the appendix for something a little different), at differences between countries before and after joining."

    "section": "2.2 The Fisher Phillips Curve",
    "text": "2.2 The Fisher Phillips Curve\nThe “Phillips curve” (Phillips 1958) describes the inverse relationship between labor (typically and most traditionally via the rate of unemployment) and prices (typically via inflation, and, in the case of Bill Phillips specifically, wage price inflation). The work of Bill Phillips was not entirely novel6, but it took his name and as such this paper will continue to refer to the associated relationship as such.For a time, macroeconomic policy was considerably informed by this simply-identified curve—the New Dealers made good use of it and, to the best they could know, it proved useful. It is this very relationship that this paper makes use of to identify the changes among European economies joining the EU.\nHowever, in the the curve was to be beset by its greatest foe, stagflation, in the 1970s, and in that era proved to not be a true rule. In fact, even looking at our own data (which will be further introduced in Section 3), it is clear that the traditional relationship (which, again, assets an inverse slope) just does not hold much across countries—at least our dataset of countries. For example, below is a plot of the Phillips relationship through time for our countries of most interest (the 2004 join-ers):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Phillips Curves\n\n\n\n\n\nAs seen in the above plot, there are only a few cases where the traditional relationship of interest is at all arguable. It is behind this backdrop that various “tweaks” to the Phillips curve would arise in hopes of making it work again. Among these, we attempts to consider changes rather than comparing variables that were arguably stationary processes. But, another idea arose, from the corner of Robert J. Gordon, the “Triangle” model of inflation7."

    "section": "2.3 Gordon’s Triangle",
    "text": "2.3 Gordon’s Triangle\nRobert J. Gordon’s “Triangle” model of inflation Gordon (2013) was devised to address the weaknesses of other “tweaks” to the old Phillips Curve relationship. The model did this by incorporating additional variables, where Gordon defined headline (aggregate) inflation to be dependent on three underlying relationships:\n\n“Underlying” inflation, accounting for predominant existing trends, or “inertia,” and functionally implemented as the lagged rate of inflation;\n“Demand-pull” inflation, accounting for the traditional Phillips curve dynamic of labor v. prices, and functionally implemented in a variety of ways across Gordon’s works; and\n“Cost-push” inflation, accounting for price shocks across specific segments of the economy that would result in shocks to the aggregate rate of inflation, and functionally implemented by including the rates of inflation for food, energy, and sometimes rental housing, and/or others.\n\nIn his later works, particularly his 2013 NBER (National Bureau of Economic Research) working paper, Gordon uses a time-varying unemployment gap derived by first calculating a time-varying natural rate of unemployment and taking the difference against the rate of unemployment Gordon (2013), much in the same way as Staiger, Stock, and Watson (1997). This is done to account for how the labor market may exercise non-constant influence across different times (and for us, different economies). Specifically, the time-varying rate of natural unemployment is derived from a cubic spline regression of a set of lags of unemployment on the core rate of inflation. From this, the intercepts are taken and divided by period (and in our case, state) to devise the rate. Then, this is subtracted from the unemployment rate by period and state to derive the time-varying unemployment gap. This gap allows implementations that include it to more thoroughly reflect labor trends and their effects given the conditions of their observation. As demonstrated in Gordon (2013), the unemployment gap tends to show coefficients of notably greater magnitude than those on the unemployment rate. Unfortunately, for this paper, the calculation of the time-varying natural rate proved extremely troublesome, and so the plain rate of unemployment is utilized for our implementation. This is a flaw, and it is hard to know how much this may have hurt our model.\nGordon is quick to note the achievements of the model, “[…] the model explained in advance in 1982 why the inflation rate fell so rapidly during 1981-86” (Gordon 2013), and while it is by no means a model grounded in modern methods to identify causal relationships8, it is a relatively simple (conceptually) and effective model for simulating inflation that still keeps the Phillips curve relationship at its core, and will thus be modified for our purposes."

The aim of this paper is to test both the continued (hint: not) strength of the Phillips curve, and to see how it applies in changes to economic dynamics among EU join-ers. For example, if Lithuania saw higher unemployment in exchange for lower inflation as per Gylfason and Hochreiter (2022), then a “spiritually” similar result would be to see a Phillips relationship at least among our join-ers, and hopefully one that notably changes in magnitude upon ascension in favor of the traditional inverse dynamic. Our contribution is this investigation."

We use only a subset, not just because some countries (including some countries of interest!) do not have observations for the 1990s, but because a number of the variables we generate for the purposes of the model require imposing lags (as will be discussed in Section 3.2), which puts additional constraints.

This model shares many similarities with Gordon (2013). Below is a table describing these subscripts and their associated lag values:\n\nModel Lags\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVector\nApplied To\nLags\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\lambda\\)\n\\(MA^\\pi\\)\n1, 5, 9, 13, 17, 21\n\n\n\\(\\mu\\)\n\\(\\pi\\)\n2:4, 6:8, 10:12, 14:16, 18:20, 22:24\n\n\n\\(\\nu\\)\n\\(\\pi^e\\), \\(\\pi^f\\)\n0:4\n\n\n\\(\\xi\\)\n\\(u\\)\n0:11\n\n\n\nThis method of writing the model was implemented to keep it as simple as possible to display and interpret. To see the full model in linear form, check Section 7.2 in the appendix. We shall, additionally, run this model across more restricted sets of data, first, concerning only our countries of interest, and second, variants concerning only pre-2004 ascension EU members to identify any unique results from applying different data restrictions alone. Think of it as robustness checks for some very pitiful results. All are run only for the subset period prior to May 2004.\nOur parameter of interest remains the unemployment rate, \\(u\\), and its relationship with our outcome, as per the traditional Phillips curve relationship. The unemployment rate is collected for working-aged individuals (15 to 64) across states and is not harmonized. Per that same consideration, absent what we saw earlier in Figure 1, we would expect that the effect of unemployment on inflation is negative. Looking back at Figure 1, it is clear that some of our countries follow that trend, and with more variables included to account for some of the variation in the outcome, we could see that be generalized. But such an outcome is doubtful, and, in truth, the result is likely that the curve fails to apply in general—at least for the baseline.\nThere are, of course, problems with this model. Chief among them is the question of stationarity which ever-hangs over when using plain inflation as a variable. Implementing a rolling mean across some of the lags does help to assuage us of the worst fears, but even there, we can see that the means among the two (of course, given one is a mean of the other) align, and differ principally in their ranges of values and variability. Moreover, seeing as out baseline considers all countries, and does not consider variation in how unemployment reverberate throughout their respective economies (something that a time-varying unemployment gap would, in-part, handle), we are sure to see many different unemployment rates crossing many different levels of headline inflation. That would track with what we saw in Figure 1 and does not spell favorable outcomes for our first regressions. The baseline model is hampered by the fact that it is being applied to a pool of many countries and by the lack of valuable pieces of information, like the time-varying natural rates of unemployment."

    "text": "4.2 Joining the EU\nThe model implemented for the purposes of this section is quite the same as the baseline in Equation 1, but now restricted to consider countries in two, distinct, periods and among two distinct subsets. This does not change the baseline estimating equation much, except that it treats our panel data more like a panel should we choose to run this all in one go. Per our earlier analysis, we would expect the coefficient on our parameter of interest, \\(u\\), remain consistent with the traditional Phillips curve relationship (assumed from Gylfason and Hochreiter (2022)), if not become more acute in that relationship. This is because: among countries not in, or not joining, the EU, they should not experience a serious change from the 2004 ascension (all else constant, and given that the states joining were not major world players), and countries that were already in the EU should have had their adjustments at whatever earlier times they joined—prior to the new wave of ascensions. In this way, countries who are not actively joining the EU, are not in the treatment group, so we split along those lines. To achieve this, we segment the data by two dummy variables (seen in Table 2): one, identifying EU membership prior to 2004 (but since 2001, pre2004member), and another identifying EU membership post-2004 (inEU2004, which is also equal to the value of pre2004member for countries prior to the ascension date). Given that our range is from 2001 to the beginning of 2007, and no countries left the EU in that period, nor did any join except in 2004, we can use these two dummies alone to successfully carve up our data as we would like (for example, the join-ers will have pre2004member + inEU2004 = 1 in the post-ascension period, whereas non-join-ers and existing members will have it = 0 and = 2, respectively). This extension will be considered with all lags to unemployment applied as in the baseline. Alongside our results from these subsets, we will apply a naive (“naive” as in, just appending a treatment and time dummy and their interaction to it) difference-in-differences variation of the model, adding terms to identify a time post ascension, and treatment (the act of joining), and the interaction of the two, to the model."

First, as noted in the footnote, all model variables were included in these regression, but the output was truncated to our parameter of interest and its lags. The full tables are available in Section 7. The coefficients on underlying inflation and its shocks were consistent with expectations based in Gordon’s prior works, and otherwise not worth much discussion. The contemporaneous unemployment term is nearly significant at the 10% level11, but is not so. These results disappointingly do not tell much more than that the relationship is generally insignificant—even the distribution of coefficients through time is only in the context of our window. Per the model, all else constant, a one percentage-point increase in unemployment, \\(u\\), in period \\(t\\), would on average see a -0.016 percentage-point decline in the contemporaneous headline rate of inflation. Period \\(t\\) would next become period \\(t-1\\), where, on average and else constant, that same one percentage-point increase would see a 0.007 percentage-point increase in the headline rate of inflation. This would continue down the line for each period in time, until the the final lagged period, \\(t-11\\), whereupon the average effect (if we want to roughly entertain this idea), where all else was held through all periods, totals to approximately a reduction of 0.16 percentage-points in headline inflation. This may sound like it is worth something in terms of economic significance, but that is conditioned by the fact that many of these coefficients are either: very small in magnitude, insignificant, have relatively large standard errors, or fit all of the above.\nConsidering a variation of Equation 1 across the same subset as Table 3 (a) that contains no lags on unemployment (only including the contemporaneous term), we arrive at a, frankly sorrowful, and entirely insignificant, coefficient of 0.0088188 on \\(u_t\\), with a standard deviation (0.0088657) larger than itself. This outcome is of course not an apples-to-apples comparison with the prior model, as we are deliberately losing some information in the process, but it helps to paint a picture of general insignificance. In fewer words, the traditional Phillips relationship fails when applied across our whole dataset, and we fail to reject the null that the rates of unemployment and inflation are particularly linked among a broad set of economies. Insignificant terms, low coefficients, and relatively high standard errors across the board.\nAgain, considering Figure 1, this is not a particular surprise. Similarly, if we consider a subset containing only our countries of interest Table 3 (b), the result is similarly muddled in insignificance and in fact is even worse in that respect—doing little to help the “cause of the curve” here either. One point of note that we do find in Table 3 (b), is that the first lag of unemployment is significant and of comparatively-large magnitude among other coefficients across the three tables. However, it is just as soon countered by an equally and oppositely significant coefficient on a further lag, amounting to more moot. It may be difficult to understand how puny these magnitudes are, so simply know that in Gordon (2013), the coefficient unemployment gap in his “Triangle” implementation was significant and negative at roughly -0.5, and even his New-Keynesian Phillips Curve models (largely similar, just not having all the same shocks and time-varying accessories) using the traditional unemployment rate, had coefficients that were significant and negative at roughly -0.19.\nLastly, considering a subset restricted to only include countries in the EU prior to the 2004 ascension Table 3 (c), we arrive at the least disappointing result of the three. The coefficient on the contemporaneous unemployment rate for that period is negative and significant at the 5% level—and, though still quite small in magnitude, not nearly so as the prior two cases. Most of the coefficients are negative, and a handful are significant. This is the only case where there is arguably a non-vestigial Phillips relationship. Considering the coefficients as in Table 3 (a), for a one percentage-point increase in unemployment, \\(u\\), in period \\(t\\), on average an else constant we would expect to see a decline of 0.0532792 percentage points in the rate of inflation, followed be a series of downstream lagged declines (or sometimes slight increases, although all of those are basically insignificant) in the next periods of inflation. Among some countries, surely, the curve is present, and perhaps the strongest case for applicability is the EU (despite the low magnitudes), but a rule is not a rule if you must pick and choose its applicability.\nWhatever the case, it appears that the Phillips relationship is not very strong in aggregate these days, but that does not deny us a comparison between the pre- and post-periods."

Below are 3 tables concerning the additional subsets (with the post-ascension period beginning with the month of ascension, May 2004):\n\n\n\nTable 4: Comparing Coefficients, Pre-/Post-2004 Ascension Among “Join-ers” and “Non-Join-ers”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) “Join-ers” Post-2004, n = 207\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariables\nCoefficients\n(SE)\n\n\n\n\n\\(u_t\\)\n0.0361668+\n\n\n\n(0.0190382)\n\n\n\\(u_{t-1}\\)\n0.0765854***\n\n\n\n(0.0206344)\n\n\n\\(u_{t-2}\\)\n0.0917911***\n\n\n\n(0.0235985)\n\n\n\\(u_{t-3}\\)\n0.0501797+\n\n\n\n(0.0270120)\n\n\n\\(u_{t-4}\\)\n-0.0177499\n\n\n\n(0.0271022)\n\n\n\\(u_{t-5}\\)\n0.0250091+\n\n\n\n(0.0141664)\n\n\n\\(u_{t-6}\\)\n-0.0010277\n\n\n\n(0.0148397)\n\n\n\\(u_{t-7}\\)\n-0.0714076***\n\n\n\n(0.0166389)\n\n\n\\(u_{t-8}\\)\n-0.1204406***\n\n\n\n(0.0218576)\n\n\n\\(u_{t-9}\\)\n-0.0746654***\n\n\n\n(0.0216435)\n\n\n\\(u_{t-10}\\)\n-0.0067565\n\n\n\n(0.0296441)\n\n\n\\(u_{t-11}\\)\n0.0420206\n\n\n\n(0.0266813)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) “Non-Join-ers” Pre-2004, n = 776\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariables\nCoefficients\n(SE)\n\n\n\n\n\\(u_t\\)\n-0.0265676\n\n\n\n(0.0211402)\n\n\n\\(u_{t-1}\\)\n0.0071577\n\n\n\n(0.0143335)\n\n\n\\(u_{t-2}\\)\n0.0279579*\n\n\n\n(0.0130221)\n\n\n\\(u_{t-3}\\)\n0.0084060\n\n\n\n(0.0212050)\n\n\n\\(u_{t-4}\\)\n0.0681393***\n\n\n\n(0.0172510)\n\n\n\\(u_{t-5}\\)\n-0.0543169***\n\n\n\n(0.0140055)\n\n\n\\(u_{t-6}\\)\n-0.0147423\n\n\n\n(0.0177657)\n\n\n\\(u_{t-7}\\)\n-0.0426256**\n\n\n\n(0.0140238)\n\n\n\\(u_{t-8}\\)\n0.0052060\n\n\n\n(0.0125269)\n\n\n\\(u_{t-9}\\)\n-0.0383009*\n\n\n\n(0.0163717)\n\n\n\\(u_{t-10}\\)\n0.0425551**\n\n\n\n(0.0162868)\n\n\n\\(u_{t-11}\\)\n-0.0542168***\n\n\n\n(0.0144995)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) “Non-Join-ers” Post-2004, n = 636\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariables\nCoefficients\n(SE)\n\n\n\n\n\\(u_t\\)\n0.0116599\n\n\n\n(0.0184492)\n\n\n\\(u_{t-1}\\)\n0.0222061\n\n\n\n(0.0138293)\n\n\n\\(u_{t-2}\\)\n0.0023293\n\n\n\n(0.0146120)\n\n\n\\(u_{t-3}\\)\n-0.0023999\n\n\n\n(0.0201968)\n\n\n\\(u_{t-4}\\)\n-0.0258058+\n\n\n\n(0.0139207)\n\n\n\\(u_{t-5}\\)\n-0.0308985+\n\n\n\n(0.0171368)\n\n\n\\(u_{t-6}\\)\n-0.0244802\n\n\n\n(0.0159395)\n\n\n\\(u_{t-7}\\)\n0.0052824\n\n\n\n(0.0131482)\n\n\n\\(u_{t-8}\\)\n-0.0389701**\n\n\n\n(0.0132885)\n\n\n\\(u_{t-9}\\)\n-0.0145678\n\n\n\n(0.0174483)\n\n\n\\(u_{t-10}\\)\n-0.0029622\n\n\n\n(0.0121239)\n\n\n\\(u_{t-11}\\)\n0.0157264\n\n\n\n(0.0134514)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+ p &lt; 0.1, * p &lt; 0.05, ** p &lt; 0.01, *** p &lt; 0.001\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the regression outputs detailed in Table 3 (b), Table 4 (a), Table 4 (b), and Table 4 (c) we can zero in principally on the coefficients of the contemporaneous (time \\(t\\)) rates of unemployment across the different subsets of data. Unfortunately, we again find little evidence to support either any kind of Phillips curve relationship across subsets, and we see a clear rebuke to the second part of our question—at least when considering these subsets themselves as singly-united groups. The coefficients became more positive among joiners. A buck in the expected trend. Running a simple difference-in-differences variation of our baseline model, we see a statistically significant and negative, but again very small, coefficient on contemporaneous unemployment. But, the damning thing is the coefficient on joiners (a treatment dummy generated based on the other dummies introduced in Section 3). Not considering the interaction (which is quite small), the coefficient on the treatment dummy itself is statistically significant and large in magnitude:\n\n\n\nTable 5: Comparing Naive DiDs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Simple DiD Model Extension\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariables\nCoefficients\n(SE)\n\n\n\n\n\\(u_t\\)\n-0.0394721***\n\n\n\n(0.0075784)\n\n\n\\(u_{t-1}\\)\n0.0043928\n\n\n\n(0.0052762)\n\n\n\\(u_{t-2}\\)\n-0.0111983+\n\n\n\n(0.0060711)\n\n\n\\(u_{t-3}\\)\n-0.0411871***\n\n\n\n(0.0062869)\n\n\n\\(u_{t-4}\\)\n0.0521342***\n\n\n\n(0.0069596)\n\n\n\\(u_{t-5}\\)\n-0.0648863***\n\n\n\n(0.0068492)\n\n\n\\(u_{t-6}\\)\n0.0198976**\n\n\n\n(0.0062217)\n\n\n\\(u_{t-7}\\)\n-0.0250560***\n\n\n\n(0.0061447)\n\n\n\\(u_{t-8}\\)\n0.0089073\n\n\n\n(0.0062464)\n\n\n\\(u_{t-9}\\)\n0.0276457***\n\n\n\n(0.0063765)\n\n\n\\(u_{t-10}\\)\n0.0238670***\n\n\n\n(0.0064501)\n\n\n\\(u_{t-11}\\)\n-0.0069471\n\n\n\n(0.0060853)\n\n\njoiners\n0.8032522***\n\n\n\n(0.1011322)\n\n\npost2004\n-0.1516057**\n\n\n\n(0.0557524)\n\n\njoiners × post2004\n-0.0068386\n\n\n\n(0.0947133)\n\n\nNum.Obs.\n1947\n\n\nR2\n0.872\n\n\nR2 Adj.\n0.868\n\n\nAIC\n3779.7\n\n\nBIC\n4142.0\n\n\nLog.Lik.\n-1824.838\n\n\nF\n201.617\n\n\nRMSE\n0.62\n\n\nStd.Errors\nHC1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Naive DiD Model (for reference)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariables\nCoefficients\n(SE)\n\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n2.3132326***\n\n\n\n(0.0438126)\n\n\njoiners\n1.0920710***\n\n\n\n(0.1789145)\n\n\npost2004\n-0.1833092**\n\n\n\n(0.0592493)\n\n\njoiners × post2004\n0.7343672***\n\n\n\n(0.2220608)\n\n\nNum.Obs.\n1971\n\n\nR2\n0.138\n\n\nR2 Adj.\n0.137\n\n\nAIC\n7480.6\n\n\nBIC\n7508.5\n\n\nLog.Lik.\n-3735.291\n\n\nF\n77.362\n\n\nRMSE\n1.61\n\n\nStd.Errors\nHC1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+ p &lt; 0.1, * p &lt; 0.05, ** p &lt; 0.01, *** p &lt; 0.001\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis coefficient on the treatment is just a fixed effect dummy, so it only flips on or off, but recall that the average rate of inflation across the whole data is 2.6 percentage points Table 2, and this dummy has a coefficient of 0.80. If we consider a truly naive model (as in Table 5 (b)), by contrast, governed entirely by the treatment and period dummies and their interaction, we see what Table 5 (a) hinted in its full cruelty: inflation was higher, on average, among the join-ers in the post-ascension period. This naive model is not meant to really “model” things, but rather to demonstrate the dynamics of these subsets in the simplest possible way. And what is tells us is to expect higher inflation among join-ers, and that is something supported both by our direct comparisons in Table 4 and in our (compared to the naive model) more realistic implementation in Table 5 (a).\nTo summarize. The Phillips relationship is not present, and even if it was, our strongest evidence from our various models suggests that join-ers saw their national rates of inflation grow upon their ascension. Considering all our model variations in sum, we find little evidence of a consistent Phillips curve relationship among any of the three primary groups: join-ers, existing members, and non-members, and find most evidence for a growth in inflation (tenuously, possibly, related to growth in unemployment, bucking the expected trend) among join-ers in the post-ascension period. If there is a traditional Phillips curve relationship to be found, this model has proved poor in ascertaining it. Our hunch, is that this is the result of missing key components of Gordon’s model that he had made serious use of. Chief among them: the time-varying rate of natural unemployment, and the unemployment gap.\nAs described in Section 2.3, the unemployment gap contains information on more than just labor. It is derived using the unemployment rate and core inflation, meaning that it contains information on both and varies with both through time. But it is also not sufficient to simply substitute in core inflation alongside the unemployment rate, because that overlooks their dynamic. No, there is a reason Gordon calculates the model by that method, and as noted again in Section 2.3, it demonstrably leads to results that are closer to expectations (Gordon 2013). But it is no matter, as a final extension, in the appendix, Section 7.1, we throw all the fixed-effects in the world at the model and see what that does (it helps!). But first, we shall conclude our principal findings."

    "text": "7.1 A DiD Diversion\nAs a final bit of fun, we include country-level fixed effects into the model and run a triple interaction on that term, the dummy term for EU members pre-ascension, and another dummy for members post-ascension. Including a table for this here would be a nightmare, so check Section 7 for that. But, one thing worth noting is that when looking at the fixed effects by country, the coefficient on Lithuania is quite small in magnitude (not negative, but small) among its peers. For example, the coefficient on Lithuania was insignificant at 0.1416405 with a standard error double that (0.3122093), whereas its neighbor to the North and fellow joiner Latvia had a significant coefficient of 1.6107148 with a standard error of about the same magnitude. Perhaps the assertions of Gylfason and Hochreiter (2022) are justified in the particular case of Lithuania!"

    "text": "1.1 A Whole Lot of Nonsense\nJust about one-hundred days into his second presidential administration, Donald Trump has investors pleading that he roll back new trade and tariff policies that have been, thus far, met with near-universal apprehension (at minimum) by American firms, American trade partners, and to a disappointingly lesser extent1, American consumers. Quarterly real GDP (gross domestic product) growth has dipped into the red for the first time in two years (2025) and most of these tariffs were only announced in April. We do not know where this will go, because we are still living with it, and the current roll-out of this policy has been about as consistent as anything else done under either Trump administration. As of early May, there is a “pause” in the excising of these new tariffs for ninety days, but it is hard to know what will come after that, among all the rhetoric. For the purposes of this paper, we will suppose that—even if they are toned down considerably—these new tariffs will come back into effect after the the pause expires. That would be a bad idea, and we need not look far to see why these policies such a bad idea—but this administration is no stranger to bad ideas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Effective Tariff Rate (USA), 1790 Onwards"

    "section": "1.2 From the Frontlines",
    "text": "1.2 From the Frontlines\nHere, we shall reflect on anecdotes sourced from a video report released in April by Burke et al. (2025) and from Meer (2025). These anecdotes are for the purposes of illustrating the effects of these tariffs in particular when too little time has really passed for much hard data. They are necessarily incomplete pictures, but provide accounts consistent with others (including others from Burke et al. (2025) who includes many interviews from many firms in their report).\n\n1.2.1 HYTE and the Cost of Tariffs\nConsidering as case in the consumer electronics space: personal computer cases and accessories company HYTE—in a rare case for the industry—invited Steve Burke of Gamers Nexus to the headquarters and permitted him look at the real costs of tariffs (as of mid-April) for their business. Here are some stylized facts from Burke et al. (2025), with numbers rounded-off:\n\nBefore the imposition of new (post-2018) tariffs on Chinese imports, HYTE’s margins were already quite thin, turning a profit of roughly only $5 per “Y40” series computer case—a 5% margin when considering the 25% margin cut taken by retailers.\nFollowing the imposition of the first round of new tariffs on Chinese imports in February (10%), landed costs for HYTE grow from from about $92 to $99, with a “tariff charge” of $7. This alone turns the slim 5% profit into a 2% loss (if the same price of $130 is maintained).\nAt the highest end (125% reciprocal plus other tariffs), as of the date HYTE had revealed their cost structure for the Y40, the tariff charge becomes roughly $121, and the landed costs balloon to nearly $215 dollars. For a case that HYTE had charged $130 (and made a small profit on), the landed costs could reach nearly double that sale price.\n\n\n\n\nIt is difficult to stress how destructive these kinds of tariff policies are, particularly for more “niche” consumer electronics firms that neither have the brand strength, the productive capacity, or the fiscal coffers to weather them. Quoting Rob Teller, Product Director at HYTE (Burke et al. 2025):\n\n[…] so, you can imagine now, if you add any tariff to this [Y40 series cost structure], the response isn’t—like—‘oh, we need to go and re-imagine how we build these things,’ it’s [instead] ‘this product is non-viable, we can’t sell products at this price anymore’ […] this market, as it stands today [mid-April, 2025] with these products, it’s not viable to manufacture and bring these products to sell in America.\n\n\n\n\\(~\\text{}~\\)\n\n\n\n\n\nY40 Case Cost Structure, Burke et al. (2025)\n\n\n\n\n\nThis problem is not something remedied by “simply” moving production to the United States. First, such a move takes considerable investment—investment which firms like HYTE, and many others, do not have the cash reserves to investigate (Burke et al. 2025) for their industries. Second, even if such a move is possible for all these firms, consumers do not buy things made in the United States. If given the choice to buy the same thing for less money, even the most patriotic are unlikely to spend much more for the pleasure. This is epitomized by A/B pricing tests for products, which are being run by some firms, in this new age, to assess how moving to US-production would pan out. Among such firms, is Afina.\n\n\n1.2.2 Afina and American Production\nAfina is a company producing filtered shower-heads. Their product is something that, in all honesty, is simple to manufacture today. This is by no means an insult—and perhaps their founder may disagree—but my point stands that these are products that should not be difficult to manufacture in most places. And this is true! Afina was able to find a domestic (in the United States) manufacturer to partner and produce their shower-heads. However, this manufacturer, has much higher operating costs than Afina’s overseas partner, so Afina wanted to know how a commensurate price increase on their final product would affect sales. To investigate this, Afina ran an A/B test: offering their product at two prices depending on if they were made in “Asia” (China and Vietnam) or the United States (Meer 2025). Below is a summary of the details and results of this test:\n\nThe shower-head, when manufactured in China and Vietnam, can be sold at a profit for $129 dollars. To maintain the same margin with the same shower-head—but have it made in the United States—the “Made in USA” variant is sold for $239 dollars.\nWhen visitors came to the site, they were offered the choice to purchase either variant, in the same menu, with all other things left untouched. Per Afina (Meer 2025), “the results were sobering.” Out of a sample of 25,650 site visitors, zero purchased the shower-head at the “Made in USA” price, and only 24 even added that option to their cart (compared to 3,560 who added the “Made in Asia” version to their carts and 584 among those who bought at the lower “Made in Asia” price).\n\nHere is a graph putting words to shape to further stress just how stark this is:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: A/B Test: Shopper Behavior by Country of Origin and Price\n\n\n\n\n\nDo not be fooled! The average consumer will not choose to spend more money than they need to, and they will not be happy with price hikes.\n\n\n1.2.3 What This Means\nHYTE and Afina are but a few wounded firms, in specific industries, among a wide spectrum of potential outcomes. But still, from these anecdotes, a narrative does arise. In general, tariffs hurt the margins of firms and thus incur price hikes on consumers. Smaller firms, or ones operating in more niche spaces, cannot afford such hikes. These firms rely on winning over customers by price. When they cannot do so, as Robert Teller at HYTE said (Burke et al. 2025), then they cannot afford to sell in the United States. This means fewer options at higher prices (prices which consumers are less likely to tolerate except in the case of “necessary” goods). This likely means less consumption expenditures, and by extent, likely an aggregate loss to welfare. And this is a case forming in the United States—the richest country on the planet. In fewer words, nations are vulnerable to their own erections of tariffs. As such, this paper assesses the vulnerability of nations to their own tariffs. To this end, we reflect on prior works concerning gains from trade and take them as a theoretical standard. We then:\n\nMake some underlying assumptions about gains related to those works;\nDefine what vulnerability means in the context of this paper; and\nConstruct a novel estimation model to assess how vulnerable a given country is per “unit” increase of tariff trade barriers;"

    "text": "2.1 Melitz (2003)\nTo say Professor Marc Melitz changed how trade was studied would be an understatement, particularly in terms of industry-level estimations. From Melitz (2003), we have a particular takeaway that is relevant to this paper:\n\nIncreases to trade openness, where more firms compete in the trade environment, map to “[…] market shares and profits [being] reallocated towards the more efficient firms”.\n\nThis is an empirically robust finding, backed in principle by the likes of Ramondo and Rodríguez-Clare (2013). To stretch this finding into a useful assumption we can say that tariffs restrict trade openness. By induction this leads to a reduction in firm-level (and more broadly, industry-level) competition, and by extent to a less efficient allocation of market shares and profits at the firm and industry levels. This is a not novel connection! This is a core tenet of the policies underlying and supporting trade liberalization, but it is good to have it said and have empirical backing for it. Ramondo and Rodríguez-Clare (2013) in particular, consider variations including multi-national production with trade itself, and find strong results in favor. Again, this is not novel, but we need it as a baseline for my model to make sense."

    "text": "2.2 Brandt et al. (2017) and Frankel and Romer (1999)\nIn their respective works, Brandt et al. (2017) and Frankel and Romer (1999) both take econometric approaches to estimating the gains (losses) from openness (closed-ness). In the latter case, authors Frankel and Romer focus on national proximity as a characteristic influencing trade and implement an instrumental variable estimation approach. This mind to proximity is intuitive, and something understood and applied across many similar works. Ideally, for our own model we would replicate their instrumental approach, but that is difficult with our chosen path. Moreover, with the data we do have, it is not necessary to construct an instrument. This is further-discussed in Section 4.2. In terms of aggregate welfare, Brandt et al. (2017), explore losses from the 2018 US-China trade war, and indeed find some—marginal—losses. This is in line with theory, and Frankel and Romer (1999) if we consider losses in a counter-factual to gains, and particularly gives us a recent comparison from the United States."

    "text": "4.2 Model\nAs outlined earlier, the model is not particularly complex. We use tariffs, which are represented by MFN observations, and bilateral aggregate trade growth to estimate income. One may think that these MFN tariff rates and trade (particularly imports) are related, and that there could be issues as a result in a traditional OLS estimation. However, if we account for trade groups (e.g., add an interaction term for the pairs of countries) to a regression of the MFN rates by imports, exports, or the total exchange, the results all return with the the three being insignificant with high p-values. When regressing only by those terms and dropping the interaction, some results come back as significant but the magnitude is tiny and we simply know that these regressions amount to little. In truth, MFN and the tariff rates are not very closely related, and that is demonstrated aptly by the below graph:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: MFN Rates Compared to Trade\n\n\n\n\n\nThe relationship seen in Figure 3 is the exact opposite of what we would expect to see were the two related closely (for an example of what we would roughly expect, see Frankel and Romer (1999)). Of course, if we were looking at other tariff rates this would likely be different, but the MFN rates are what we are equipped to use. Below is the regression output for first-differenced total exchange on the MFN rates with bilateral-pair fixed-effects and their interaction:\n\n\n\nTable 1: Regression Output for Total Exchange (First-Differenced) on MFN Rates\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n1114313450.5705128\n\n\n\n(4871899679.6824389)\n\n\nMFN_average\n61038841.4874088\n\n\n\n(342440377.7778928)\n\n\nbilateral_pairCHN_USA\n43222849282.6977768+\n\n\n\n(24641166999.0215988)\n\n\nbilateral_pairIND_CHN\n16474507115.7421131+\n\n\n\n(8943547955.3250179)\n\n\nbilateral_pairIND_USA\n4155709646.1875396\n\n\n\n(5073695569.5954018)\n\n\nMFN_average × bilateral_pairCHN_USA\n-3041547371.5486841\n\n\n\n(2325668277.3981757)\n\n\nMFN_average × bilateral_pairIND_CHN\n-702248988.7707369\n\n\n\n(456504849.4759484)\n\n\nMFN_average × bilateral_pairIND_USA\n-164891266.9506708\n\n\n\n(354209036.3498886)\n\n\nNum.Obs.\n114\n\n\nR2\n0.111\n\n\nR2 Adj.\n0.053\n\n\nAIC\n5855.0\n\n\nBIC\n5879.6\n\n\nLog.Lik.\n-2918.499\n\n\nF\n2.025\n\n\nRMSE\n31774549908.24\n\n\nStd.Errors\nHC1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith these considerations in mind, we run a model using bilateral country-pair fixed effects and their interactions for total trade exchange changes and MFN rates. We continue to use changes, rather than the contemporaneous total, because it allows us to consider adjustments in totals through time. Our estimation equation is detailed below:\n\\[\nY_{t} = \\Delta \\text{Trade}_{t} + \\text{Tariff}_{t} \\times \\text{CountryPair}_{jk}\n\\tag{1}\\]\nwhere for countries \\(j\\) and \\(k\\) in time \\(t\\), the average tariff imposed is \\(\\text{Tariff}\\), the lagged growth in aggregate bilateral trade is \\(\\Delta \\text{Trade}\\), and the bilateral pair is \\(\\text{CountryPair}\\). Rather than segmenting the MFN rates and tariffs by country, we consider them in aggregate but apply our fixed-effects for the bilateral pair. This is a less precise estimation, but it keeps the interpretations simple. Tariffs in this period are assumed to be new impositions, this will not be true across all cases but is a simplifying assumption."
