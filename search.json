    "text": "1 Something Isn‚Äôt Right\n There has been a lot in the news about ‚Äúrecession‚Äù recently and, considering current data, it does not make much sense.  While wages went up (USBLS) and comparatively decent jobs remain available, half the country seems to think that we are back in 2008. Hell, unemployment is back to pre-pandemic levels (USBLS), with long-term unemployment (27 weeks or more) falling as well, and the federal funds rate, while rising steeply, just hit what it was around this same time in 2019 (FRED). It is not like nothing is going on, though, something must be off for people to be so concerned, so what is it? Prices. That is it, or a lot of it. The confluence of ongoing supply chain issues, a war in one of the most vital exporting countries in the grain market (WSJ) instigated by an important export country in the natural gas market, greed, and yes, to an extent the rapid expansion of the money supply from government assistance during the pandemic has worked out to a sharp rise in prices across the board. Is this concerning? Absolutely. Is this a recession? No.¬†So why do I keep hearing the word?\n\n\n2 Ignoring the Data\nIn 2020 a global pandemic threw the global economy for a loop. Industries whose work could not easily be transferred online declined and millions of people were suddenly unemployed, and no one was sure when exactly things would end. Two years later and the pandemic is still close to us. Some of those millions who were unemployed, and many others, are dead now. But one could be forgiven for mistaking that things had passed with how little care many seem to have anymore. This general sense of apathy, or at least conscious ignorance, has grown so bad in fact that there is already some whole new pandemic and I have yet to hear a single real person share much concern over it. No one wants to care about anymore, and the governments of the world‚Äîwhich had at one time thrown enormous sums of money into the void which constituted their pandemic economies‚Äîhave just as quickly dropped all mandates and shoved everyone back to the workplace. On one hand this makes sense, there is a feeling that prior to the pandemic things made some kind of sense and that organizations should return to their state of being. On the other hand, over one million people have died, just in the United States, and many are still dying, and no matter how much we choose to ignore it, things are not just going to become normal.\nBut what does any of that have to do with our present recessionary woes? A great deal, actually.\nThe trouble with selectively detaching yourself from the realities before you is that it becomes hard to keep up with everything else. While national economies are no strangers to emotion‚Äîlook no further than the intense volatility of some stocks to see how impactful feelings can be‚Äîthe degree to which many are now just going with their guts on this whole thing is almost unprecedented. The stubbornness with which we continue to ignore the presence of a deadly pandemic has made its way into how we think about a great many things. In this case then, ‚Äúrecession‚Äù has taken on a whole new meaning, realistically becoming a buzzword for ‚Äúthings are bad and I don‚Äôt like it,‚Äù or, more appropriately the current ‚Äúbad vibes.‚Äù This situation is articulated well by Felix Salmon and Elizabeth Spiers in a recent episode of the podcast Slate Money;\n[Elizabeth Spiers] ‚ÄúI think people conflate their sense of financial security with a sense of overall stability and security in general. So if there is a lot of chaos happening in the world, they will automatically sort of assume that this is affecting them economically, even though it might not be the case.‚Äù\nGranted many are hit hard by soaring prices for goods but the point stands. A lot is happening, we have gone over this, and emotional overload is both very real and very reasonable given the state of affairs in the past few years but even still what could convince people that things are so unstable? One example could be the rollback of government programs as we reenter our faux normalcy, but the fact is that many of those programs worked in service of businesses more than individual people, at least directly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3 But the Markets!\nNowhere do we see the presence of this ‚Äúbad vibes‚Äù mentality more than in the stock market, the beating heart of volatility, and more importantly, something often conflated with economic health and well-being. As Felix Salmon says, ‚ÄúThe stock market. Your stocks are down. Used to feel wealthy because stocks were up high and rising. Now you feel poor because stocks are lower and falling.‚Äù It really is a perfect kind of storm. For many years there has been this beating of the drum to instill the idea that the market and the economy are linked, and to be fair, it is not so much that they are not as it is that that is not the whole story. But nevertheless, people look towards this mythical thing for answers and right now it is not giving particularly good ones. At the same time people are again going with their guts and so there is a combination of feeling bad and then hearing dreadful things from one of the main places you look. This is not to mention how much big words catch headlines so I cannot help but side-eye publishers and agencies for opining the end of prosperity for clicks. The market was also just performing phenomenally while millions were unemployed and starving so again, it is not really reflective of how things are doing.\n\n\n4 The Near Future\nOne of the most worrying things about this whole situation though is that, at the end of everything, economic health is genuinely dependent on our deeply personal faith in how things are going. When people lose faith, as many are, that‚Äôs when things start to go wrong fast. It is a tough situation because there are significant issues right now facing us down economically‚Äîthe number of people presently unhoused is growing and rising costs certainly are not helping (Washington Post), and the minimum wage is nowhere near when it needs to be‚Äîand they are only magnified by the kind of fear that comes with words like recession. Luckily, the ‚Äúvibe‚Äù has not yet soured enough for people to stop spending, which means that things might just work out if we can get inflation under control.\n\nReferences\n\n1.

    "title": "A Short Look at Rural Education",
    "section": "",
    "text": "1 A Bit About Small Towns\nThere is a saying, oft-repeated in the description of plaguing ills, which tells very well the tragedy of places that are neither wholly rural, nor truly city and are certainly not suburbia. First slowly, then suddenly. The small town‚Äîthe rural city‚Äîis a pocket‚Äîa vestige of what could have been looking out from some time immemorial when suburbia had not yet come to dominate. While the image of rural America‚Äîbutchered by popular depictions‚Äîmay tell of places hardly able to provide much of anything to their citizenry, the rural city is different. The rural city can provide, for now. But what after? There is little to do. A space of some thousands in number, educated relatively well, surrounded by dead industry and minimum wage service jobs. Sure, there are most opportunities available than in the truly empty spaces, but why stay for something so‚ÄîI feel very sorry to put it like this‚Äîmiddling? The tragedy of these places is that they manage to provide more than they are worth‚Äîcomparatively speaking‚Äîand present little reason to do anything but leave. ‚Äú[‚Ä¶] Small towns are especially good at recognizing, nurturing, and launching talented individuals. They rally to prepare achievers to leave, succeed brilliantly in doing so, then lament the loss of their combined talents‚Äù (Carr & Kefalas, p. 51). I do not want to dwell too long on this note, but keep it in mind as I talk about some interesting aspects of American rural education.\n\n\n2 Educational Attainment\nThe trope of the uneducated or undereducated rural is a gross exaggeration, and it washes over the variety of conditions which exist concerning education in rural America. When looking at primary and secondary education levels, the discrepancy is not exactly enormous. Particularly in the case of the former, ‚Äú[rural children] perform as well as urban children on standardized tests‚Äù (Clark, et al.). While standardized testing is a whole assortment of problems on its own, the fact the performance is generally consistent between rural and urban communities lends credence to the idea that the education gap below the post-secondary collegiate level is overblown. Where a clear discrepancy does exist though, is when it comes to higher levels of educational attainment. In terms of collegiate educational attainment ‚Äú[rural students are behind] suburban and urban counterparts [‚Ä¶] largely because of their lower socioeconomic background‚Äù (Byun, et al.). What is curious though, is that rural areas across the country tend to underperform the trend more at higher levels of income (see the figure below). The more potentially well-off, the worse the performance relatively.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis can be explained as rural counties simply making up a greater proportion of lower median income counties, but even with that in mind, urban counties at lower income levels do not tend to perform nearly as often and far above the trendline as they do at higher levels of income. The disparity between rural and urban educational achievement grows with greater levels of income. In this case, rurality is a greater determinant of attainment than income, but that is because the positive impact of rising incomes on education is conditioned by the negative impact of rurality. What could that negative impact be?\n\n\n3 Rural Income Inequality\nIt is not just that rural America is poor, it is that ‚Äú[‚Ä¶] high levels of local income inequality have been a disproportionally rural issue over the past half-century‚Äù (Butler, et al.). There are actually many places in the United States that are both very rural and very affluent but living in them as a less-than-affluent individual is a quick ticket to a harsh life. Less dense regions have a lesser availability of public resources to aid individuals who need help and that means that as you start climbing the ladder of costs‚Äîgoing to college is slightly more expensive than the 3rd grade‚Äîthose unable to bridge the gap will not. This is not the only factor, of course, and that is visible in the fact that at the state-level, sometimes the rural-urban divide on educational attainment is not so significant. For example, according to data from the U.S. Census and the American Community Survey (ACS), the divide in the state of Texas is significantly less pronounced than that in the states of Alabama, Kansas, or West Virginia. Still, we see at the national level that there is a correlation between median income and educational attainment, and we see that rural counties underperform relative to urban ones as median income levels rise.\n\n\n4 A Tangent About Rural Out-migration\nRecall the small town. What, thinking between income and post-secondary collegiate education, primarily influences out-migration from rural areas? Looking again at county-level data from the U.S. Census and ACS, in the states of Vermont and West Virginia, the rural counties that did not experience population decline between 2010 and 2020 tended to be wealthier. In West Virginia for example, Pleasants County with one of the lowest number of residents, 25 years or older, recorded as holding a bachelor‚Äôs degree or higher at 11.9%, was one of only 6 counties‚Äî4 rural counties‚Äîthat did not experience decline from 2010 to 2020. The counties not experiencing out-migration were, in all, less relatively poor than they were relatively or strictly uneducated. Income is a greater determinant than educational attainment in cases of migration when the two are examined purely side-by-side. The counties that did not experience population decline tended to be wealthier, even when they were not always particularly well educated compared to the rest of the state. Do people leave because they are educated or because they can make more money? There is a difference.\n\n\n5 Returning to Income\nIf the goal is strictly to improve collegiate educational attainment on the whole among rural American counties, it is easier to just say ‚Äúgive people money,‚Äù in light of how complex accounting for rurality becomes. I wholeheartedly support that measure as a currently poor college student (as of 2023, fingers crossed I win the lottery), but unfortunately it does not play well politically. Incomes would have to be raised endogenously, but how? Remember the small towns, people leave the moment they think they have the tools to make it somewhere better. Moreover due to regional variation, it is clear that some places will not even see much change in outcome from higher levels of income. What is more actionable? What could prepare people for jobs that are available even in rural spaces (not counting remote work but that is valuable to consider) such that they will not just leave, and what could do so for less than what is charged by universities today?\n\n\n6 One Idea\nTrade work is many things, but to avoid going into excruciating detail, think welders, electricians, mechanics, and all jobs of that nature. Trade work can be learned at trade schools. Trade schools tend to not only be cheaper than a baccalaureate education, but can provide an education that is‚Äîdepending on the subject of study‚Äîapplicable in almost any place, serving as a reliable ticket to employment even in rural counties. Additionally, vocational education can serve as an outlet for students who tend to underperform individually in classroom environments (Rich). This is skilled work that pays well, or at least better than a lot of work available in rural areas. This is also work that requires an education and ‚Äú[requires] workers who can interpret blueprints, program computerized machinery and solve problems on the fly‚Äù (Rich). Despite this, the federal government has not pinned nearly as much value as should be onto these institutions as possible centers of rural education in the past few years (Rich), allowing trade schools to fall out of the immediate mind even among some who live in the areas which could most benefit.\nTrade schools are cheaper to attend and can provide an education that is more than applicable to the job market in rural counties. The point is not to prevent people from pursuing an academic career, it is to promote an alternative that could convince them to stay closer to home by giving them a way to actually make money there. Additionally, opening up vocational opportunities could get older residents in rural counties back to school, which would improve general education in counties. ‚ÄúIn the future, most young adults will need post-secondary education in order to find good-paying jobs. However, millions of so-called ‚Äòmiddle skill jobs‚Äô will require something less than a bachelor‚Äôs degree‚Äù (Harvard Graduate School of Education). Again, this is an alternative that makes sense in the context of wanting to raise incomes and keep populations within rural communities as it will achieve one by the other and vice versa. These institutions have their own problems, and I will at some point expand on them, but for now I will close by saying that I think they are valuable to improving both incomes in rural areas and reducing out-migration. Perhaps, as incomes rise, more will later go on to pursue a baccalaureate education and hopefully, there will be more opportunities to use that degree at home in future.\n\nReferences\n\n1.

    "title": "The Phillips Curve is Alive and Well in 2023",
    "section": "",
    "text": "1 Introduction\nThe Phillips curve occupies a curious space in post-pandemic economics discourse. While considered ‚Äúdead‚Äù by some, and with some of the strongest evidence for its death coming from the reversal in relationship between inflation and unemployment during that period, it is worth investigating if the issue is the relationship itself, or instead a misspecification of it. Given the significance of both inflation and unemployment concerning economic health, a relationship between the two is an important guide for economic policymakers. To investigate this relationship and how it holds up in 2023, I take quarterly economic data on the United States economy and adopt an econometric variant of the Phillips curve relationship developed by Gordon (2013) and evaluate how well the econometric model matches real values for inflation in the economy. I find that the relationship between unemployment and inflation is indeed still an inverse one, at least in aggregate, with the coefficient on the contemporaneous unemployment gap (unemployment less the natural rate of unemployment) being -0.1097, meaning that the inflation rate is that much lower per 1-point increase in the unemployment gap of the current period. Additionally, I find that the model by Gordon (2013) accurately simulates values for inflation given data from the period.\n\n\n2 Literature Review\nThe traditional Phillips curve (traditional curve hereafter) comes from a relationship identified by Bill Phillips between wage pricing and unemployment which was broadened to be defined as one between inflation and unemployment. According to the traditional curve, inflation and unemployment are inversely related‚Äîas one goes up, the other goes down. This curve is taught in introductory macroeconomics courses. Given the significance of both inflation and unemployment concerning economic health, the relationship identified between the two took on an important role of its own‚Äîa guide for economic policy. Unfortunately for the proud curve (relating two stationary processes), the relationship would not survive the pains of the 1970s.\n\nThe 1970s saw a period of stagflation‚Äîhigh inflation conjoined by high unemployment. This was a total reversal in the prior-established relationship of the traditional curve and signaled its weaknesses for the years to come. In response to this change, Robert J. Gordon developed what would become known as the ‚Äútriangle model‚Äù (Gordon et al. 1977; Gordon 1981). In the model, Gordon defines the inflation rate as being dependent on three fundamental elements: underlying inflation, inertia; aggregate demand-pull inflation, demand; and cost push inflation, supply. The first is a lagged rate of inflation, the second is an ‚Äú[‚Ä¶] index of excess demand‚Äù Gordon (1997), which in this case is the unemployment gap, and the third is a number of supply shocks (e.g., food and energy price indices, etc.). For the unemployment gap, Gordon (1997);Gordon (2013) follows the methodology of Staiger, Stock, and Watson (1997) to derive a time-varying natural rate of unemployment (TV-NAIRU hereafter). This method involves regressing lags of the unemployment rate‚Äîalongside some supply shock variables depending on who is doing this, Gordon (2013) says excluding shocks for the TV-NAIRU results in better estimates‚Äîon the change in inflation, then dividing the intercept coefficient by the coefficients on the lagged unemployment rate regressors and applying a cubic spline. Consider a model where core inflation is regressed on four lags of the unemployment rate:\n\\[\n\\pi_{t} = \\beta_{0}+\\beta_{1}u_{t-1}+\\beta_{2}u_{t-2}+\\beta_{3}u_{t-3}+\\beta_{4}u_{t-4} \\label{eq:eq_NAIRU1} \\tag{1}\n\\]\nwhere the NAIRU could be derived via Staiger, Stock, and Watson (1997):\n\\[\n\\overline{u} = \\frac{\\beta_{0}}{\\beta_{1}+\\beta_{2}+\\beta_{3}+\\beta_{4}} \\label{eq:eq_NAIRU2} \\tag{2}\n\\]\nDoing this over an extended period with a cubic polynomial spline function, one can derive values for the TV-NAIRU through time. Underlying inflation is lagged, demand pull, and cost push inflation can be both contemporaneous and lagged. A simple implementation of the triangle model would be:\n\\[\n\\pi_{t} = \\beta_{0}+\\beta_{1}\\pi_{t-1}+\\beta_{2}(u_{t}-\\overline{u_{t}})+\\beta_{3}X_{t} \\label{eq:eq_NAIRU3} \\tag{3}\n\\]\nwhere Œß is a matrix containing whatever cost push supply shocks are being used. Gordon‚Äôs model proved itself to be capable of providing reasonably accurate estimates for inflation, and Gordon himself loves to tout some of the achievements of the triangle model‚Äîa prime example: ‚Äú[‚Ä¶] the model explained in advance in 1982 why the inflation rate fell so rapidly during 1981-86‚Äù (Gordon 2013). There are, however, many other variations of the traditional curve. One popular variation is the accelerationist Phillips curve.\n\nThe accelerationist Phillips curve (accelerationist curve hereafter) can be traced to Gordon (1968) and takes the relationship of the traditional curve but supplants the unemployment rate with the unemployment gap‚Äîjust as the triangle model‚Äîand the inflation rate with the change in the inflation rate. The change in the inflation rate is derived by simply taking the first differences between periods. Friedman noted that inflation was dependent on inflationary expectations and that individuals‚Äô expectations for inflation were conditioned by past values of it. An implementation of the accelerationist curve could look like (Ball and Mazumder, 2015):\n\\[\n\\pi_{t}-\\pi_{t-1} = \\alpha(u_{t}-\\overline{u_{t}})+\\epsilon_{t} \\label{eq:eq_accel1} \\tag{4}\n\\]\nrewriting this also helps explain why the triangle model uses inflation as the dependent variable and as regressors rather than a change in inflation:\n\\[\n\\pi_{t} = \\pi_{t-1}+\\alpha(u_{t}-\\overline{u_{t}})+\\epsilon_{t} \\label{eq:eq_accel2} \\tag{5}\n\\]\nThis somewhat resembles the simple form of the triangle model displayed earlier. Although the accelerationist curve was thought up prior to the stagflation of the 1970s, it too‚Äîjust as the triangle model‚Äîdoes a better job of making sense of that period and the periods to follow than the traditional curve does. Unfortunately, the accelerationist curve does not do as well when presented with inflation and unemployment trends of the late-2000s to early-2010s.\n\nAs Gordon (2013) points out, the Phillips curve‚Äîincluding the accelerationist curve (Ball and Mazumder, 2015)‚Äîdoes not do an excellent job at explaining late 2000s inflation. The estimates for inflation, given data on unemployment and prior inflation, should be negative (e.g., we should be seeing deflation according to the traditional and accelerationist curves). This problem is referred to as the missing deflation puzzle as we are seemingly overdue for deflation. Generally, there are two groups with two respective explanations for the missing deflation puzzle (Ball and Mazumder, 2015). James Stock and Robert Gordon (Gordon 2013) say that the problem lay with the unemployment rate being used and argue that the correct specification to solve the missing deflation puzzle would focus on short-term unemployment (e.g., 26 weeks or less) rather than total unemployment. Focusing on short-term rather than total does help explain why ‚Äú[‚Ä¶] inflation has not fallen by more, because short-term unemployment rose less sharply than total unemployment over 2008-2009 and has since returned to pre-recession levels‚Äù (Ball and Mazumder, 2015). Alternatively, other economists argue that the long-standing commitment to a 2% inflation target in the United States has led inflationary expectations to become anchored, preventing ‚Äú[‚Ä¶] actual inflation from falling very far below that level‚Äù (Ball and Mazumder, 2015). But Gordon (2013) also focuses on supply shocks as a crucial factor in modelling inflation and points plainly to the triangle model‚Äîwhatever the unemployment specification‚Äîas a solution to the missing inflation puzzle. This is what most differentiates the triangle model from, say, the accelerationist curve.\n\nThe triangle model not only does well in accounting for the trends of the 1970s, but unlike the accelerationist curve also does well in accounting for the trends of the late 2000s. According to Gordon (2013), there is hardly even a deflation puzzle at all, and the problem sits squarely with specifications. In fact, Gordon goes as far as to write ‚Äú[‚Ä¶] all of the NKPC [New-Keynesian Phillips Curve] literature over the past 15 years, as well as most other research on inflation, fails to include explicit variables to measure the impact of supply shocks. As a result, their misspecified equations attempt to explain the inflation rate that depends on both demand and supply with only a demand variable‚Äù (Gordon 2013). Fighting words by the standards of academia‚Äîas an aside, simply imagine a respected academic in your field refer to your hard work like this. Regardless, that is how things stood as of 2013.\n\n\n3 Data\n\n\n\nTable¬†1: Summary Statistics (Q1 1947-Q2 2023)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariables1\nn\nmean\nsd\nmin\nmax\nrange\nse\n\n\n\n\nPCECTPI\n306\n51.457\n33.021\n11.557\n120.044\n108.487\n1.888\n\n\nJCXFE\n258\n58.711\n30.943\n15.515\n118.938\n103.423\n1.926\n\n\nUNRATE\n302\n5.718\n1.7\n2.567\n12.967\n10.4\n0.098\n\n\nST_UNRATE\n302\n4.711\n1.25\n2.497\n12.246\n9.749\n0.072\n\n\nOPHNFB\n306\n62.283\n26.87\n23.258\n115.405\n92.147\n1.536\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe data collected for this paper is sourced primarily from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA hereafter) and the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS hereafter) via the St.¬†Louis Federal Reserve database (FRED hereafter). The individual datasets are included in the references section, and my compiled datasets are included in the appendix. The FRED stores huge swathes of data from various national and international sources and is dependable. PCECTPI is the Personal Consumption Expenditures index (PCE Headline hereafter), JCXFE is the Personal Consumption Expenditures Less Food and Energy index (PCE Core hereafter), UNRATE is the unemployment rate, ST_UNRATE is the short-term unemployment rate, and OPHNFB is the productivity of nonfarm labor by output per hours worked. The data is quarterly time-series data ending in Q2 2023, with some sets of data being available further back in time than others. Data on the unemployment rate, for example, is available from the BEA as far back as Q1 1948, while PCE Core is only available starting at Q1 1959. All data sourced externally is available by the 1960s and onward. With this in mind, I exclude all data prior to Q1 1960 before making any further changes. I do not end up using short-term unemployment in the triangle model implementation adopted from Gordon (2013) but, I include it with the other data because it is available. I exclude the date variable from the summary statistics tables because it is unnecessary.

The data compiled was transformed to create additional variables (e.g., inflation, differences, changes, moving averages, trends) including a dummy variable, NIXON (subdivided into nixon_price_on and nixon_price_off), that was added to account for the price controls of the Nixon administration using values defined by Gordon (1997);Gordon (2013). Inflation variables are calculated by taking the change between years by quarter in the PCE Core and Headline price indicies. The changes in inflation are calculated by taking the first differences of inflation. The moving averages of inflation are calculated by taking the difference of inflation in one period and the natural logarithm of inflation four quarters prior (Gordon 2013). The food energy effect is the difference between PCE Headline and PCE Core and the food energy effect (late period) is a binary dummy variable where observations prior to 1987 are set to 0 and observations after are equal to the former (Gordon 2013). LT_UNRATE is long-term unemployment and is the difference between UNRATE and ST_UNRATE. The the 8-quarter productivity trend is derived from the 8-quarter percent change in OPHNFB (8-quarter actual productivity) with a Hodrick-Prescott filter (Œª = 6400) applied (Gordon 2013). A Hodrick-Prescott filter is useful for just getting the long-run trends of data and Gordon makes effective use of it because of that. This dataset was also compiled in R (see appendix: ‚ÄúDATA.R‚Äù and ‚ÄúDataComplete.csv).

The PCE Core inflation change variable is missing an observation for Q1 1960 but otherwise all variables have observations from then onward. Below is a comparison between Core and Headline PCE:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†1: Headline vs.¬†Core PCE Inflation\n\n\n\nLastly, since the accelerationist curve and triangle model use the unemployment gap rather than the unemployment rate, I estimate values for a TV-NAIRU. I create my estimates not by the cubic polynomial spline regression employed by Staiger, Stock, and Watson (1997) and Gordon (1997);Gordon (2013) but instead by running a rolling regression of the unemployment rate on Core PCE inflation. I chose to follow this method under the advice of Professor Sicotte as the alternative spline method was difficult to manage. A rolling regression is easier to implement as it functions as a regular linear model but allows for change over time between periods defined by a ‚Äúwindow‚Äù of observations. Recalling the earlier regression specification (equation 1) from the literature review, I use the same model but run a rolling regression with a window with a 52-quarter width. I then derive TV-NAIRU estimates according to equation 2 derived from the example by Staiger, Stock, Watson, (1997). The estimates for the TV-NAIRU (NAIRU) achieved by this method are around where one would expect a NAIRU value to be but, the estimates are jagged and change noticeably between individual periods. This is not something wanted from a variable meant to demonstrate long-run trends but luckily this can be resolved by running a Hodrick-Prescott filter (Œª = 1600) on the estimates to return smoothed values (NAIRU_smoothed). I then calculate the unemployment gap (UNGAP) by taking the difference between unemployment and the smoothed TV-NAIRU. I also record the unemployment gap using the unsmoothed estimates (UNGAP_raw) just to be thorough, although I do not use them. My method for estimating the TV-NAIRU unfortunately restricts the usable period of data even further to the 1970s and onward as 13 years (52 quarters) of data between the 1960s and 1970s do not have observations for the TV-NAIRU or the unemployment gap. Below is a graph comparing the smoothed and unsmoothed TV-NAIRU values for the unemployment gap:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†2: Smoothed vs.¬†Unsmoothed TV-NAIRU Unemployment Gap\n\n\n\nThe smoothed unemployment gap is particularly less jagged during the labor market weirdness of the CoVid-19 pandemic which is helpful for the analysis of this paper.

The only variable not included is the relative price of imports as I simply could not find a source with observations going back far enough to be useful or worthwhile to include.\n\n\n4 The Curves\nAs noted before, the traditional curve demonstrates the relationship between the rates of inflation and unemployment. Specifically, the relationship should be an inverse one. Shown below is a graph with a traditional curve constructed by decade with quarterly data from each quarter from Q1 1960 to Q2 2023:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†3: Traditional Phillips Curve\n\n\n\nThis representation demonstrates the central issue of the traditional curve‚Äîparticularly in the 1970s‚Äîand why it is hardly even used anymore. I used data going back to the 1960s because it was available given that the traditional curve does not use the unemployment gap but rather the unemployment rate. As can be seen in the line of fit, the relationship between inflation and unemployment is not inverse over a period from the 1960s to the 2020s. If we were to zoom in on particular decades, we would see that the inverse relationship sometimes holds, but is completely upended in the 1970s‚Äîobservable in seeing which decades most of the quarters of simultaneously high inflation and high unemployment are on the graph. The traditional curve is not up to the task and that is precisely why other specifications, like the accelerationist curve, have been more popular since the 1970s.\n\nThe accelerationist curve demonstrates the relationship between the change of the rate of inflation and the unemployment gap. Shown below is a graph with an accelerationist curve constructed by decade with the data from each quarter from Q4 1974 to Q2 2023:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†4: Accelerationist Phillips Curve\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn contrast to the traditional curve, the accelerationist curve manages to maintain the inverse relationship over a period of decades. Does this mean that the accelerationist curve is a good specification? No, but it is at least a better one. To demonstrate why this alone is not sufficient, consider how the trend may look by decade. On the right is a graph of multiple accelerationist curves by decade, it is almost flat for several decades:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†5: Accelerationist Phillips Curve by Decade\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough the accelerationist curve does do well with data from the 1970s many decades show an extremely slight inverse relationship (if at all), and the 2010s show a positive one! This is where the accelerationist curve fails. To go further, consider equation 5 from earlier. Running a regression of the unemployment gap on the change in inflation nets us the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†6: Accelerationist Phillips Curve Model Estimates\n\n\n\nThis is not particularly bad, in fact since the actual changes in inflation swing more in both directions, the ‚Äúaggregate‚Äù change within a given number of periods is not far off. The problem is that our \\(R^{2}\\) is small. A model including just the unemployment gap on the change in inflation accounts for a small percentage of variation in the change in inflation and that is clear in the graph above. To the right is the regression output using the ‚Äústargazer‚Äù package (Hlavac, 2020) for R:\n\n\n\nTable¬†5: Accelerationist Phillips Curve Model Regression Table\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf one were to take the predicted values for the change in inflation from the estimation of this model for a period and the lagged inflation of preceeding period, they would get something that does not look terrible on first glance, but is quickly revealedd to be little more than a lagged chart of inflation give or take the tiny estimate for the change in inflation. Put another way, they would get something that looks like a slightly tweaked AR(1) model‚Äînot especially useful for actually modelling past (and particularly future) inflation.\n\nThe traditional curve is simply not suitable for showing its desired relationship between inflation and unemployment and the accelerationist curve does not make for a good model of it over time despite at least generally maintaining the expected relationship. With the varying failures of both perhaps there is truth in the death of the curve. Robert J. Gordon though, disagrees‚Äîthe problem is not that the relationship is not there, you just need to through the kitchen sink at it‚Äîand so comes the triangle model.\n\n\n5 The Mighty Trianlge (Model and Methodology)\nThe triangle model is not that radical of a change. It is like the accelerationist curve (recall how equation 5 is written) bar the fact that it includes supply shocks alongside the unemployment gap and lagged inflation (Gordon 2013). This single difference helps the model become far better at matching actual inflation with its predictions. The model used in this paper is adapted from the model used by Gordon (2013). Although that version was from a working paper, Gordon writes that the implementation is not far different from that of his 1997 paper. One significant difference between that implementation and that of this paper is the observation period. Gordon‚Äôs data (2013) goes from the 1960s to the 2010s whereas mine goes from the 1970s to the 2020s. For the Phillips curve to be dead, the relationship between inflation and unemployment would have to be a non-factor. As such, any results showing something contrary are signs of life. What matters though, is if the relationship can still be implemented such that a strong model of inflation can be constructed.\n\nThe model specified by Gordon includes the following: several lags of headline inflation (including moving averages), the unemployment gap and lags of it, the food energy effect (late period) and lags of it, the relative price of imports and lags of it, and the 8-quarter productivity trend and lags of it (Gordon 2013). I do not have data for the relative prices of imports, so the specification of the model used here is as follows:\n\\[\n\\pi_{t} = \\beta_{0}+\\beta_{1}MA\\pi_{t-1}+\\beta_{2}\\pi_{t-2}+\\beta_{3}\\pi_{t-3}+\\beta_{4}\\pi_{t-4}+\\beta_{5}MA\\pi_{t-5}\n\\] \\[\n+\\beta_{6}\\pi_{t-6}+\\beta_{7}\\pi_{t-7}+\\beta_{8}\\pi_{t-8}+\\beta_{9}MA\\pi_{t-9}+\\beta_{10}\\pi_{t-10}\n\\] \\[\n+\\beta_{11}\\pi_{t-11}+\\beta_{12}\\pi_{t-12}+\\beta_{13}MA\\pi_{t-13}+\\beta_{14}\\pi_{t-14}+\\beta_{15}\\pi_{t-15}\n\\] \\[\n+\\beta_{16}\\pi_{t-16}+\\beta_{17}MA\\pi_{t-17}+\\beta_{18}\\pi_{t-18}+\\beta_{19}\\pi_{t-19}+\\beta_{20}\\pi_{t-20}\n\\] \\[\n+\\beta_{21}MA\\pi_{t-21}+\\beta_{22}\\pi_{t-22}+\\beta_{23}\\pi_{t-23}+\\beta_{24}\\pi_{t-24}+\\beta_{25}(u_{t}-\\overline{u_{t}}) \\label{eq:model1} \\tag{6}\n\\] \\[\n+\\beta_{26}(u_{t-1}-\\overline{u_{t-1}})+\\beta_{27}(u_{t-2}-\\overline{u_{t-2}})+\\beta_{28}(u_{t-3}-\\overline{u_{t-3}})+\\beta_{29}(u_{t-4}-\\overline{u_{t-4}})+\\beta_{30}fe_{t}\n\\] \\[\n+\\beta_{31}fe_{t-1}+\\beta_{32}fe_{t-2}+\\beta_{33}fe_{t-3}+\\beta_{34}fe_{t-4}+\\beta_{35}latefe_{t}\n\\] \\[\n+\\beta_{36}latefe_{t-1}+\\beta_{37}latefe_{t-2}+\\beta_{38}latefe_{t-3}+\\beta_{39}latefe_{t-4}+\\beta_{40}prodtrend_{t-1}\n\\] \\[\n+\\beta_{41}prodtrend_{t-2}+\\beta_{42}prodtrend_{t-3}+\\beta_{43}prodtrend_{t-4}+\\beta_{44}prodtrend_{t-5}\n\\]\nThe model itself clearly has some questionable aspects. For example, although inflation is only stationary at the 10% significance level (see below Augmented Dickey-Fuller test on Headline PCE), it is still not very kosher to use inflation rather than the change in it.\n\n\n\nTable¬†6: Augemented Dickey-Fuller Test on Headline PCE Inflation\n\n\n\n\n\nstatistic\np.value\nparameter\nalternative\n\n\n\n\n-3.2027\n0.089\nheadline_inflation\nstationary\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, if this is good enough for Gordon, I struggle to believe that it could be completely wrong. This implementation can very fairly be described as throwing the kitchen sink at data. The thing is, that it also still does demonstrate the validity of the relationship first identified by Bill Phillips almost a century ago. After running the initial regression, I keep only the regressors that were significant (see appendix: ‚Äúfirst_regression.png‚Äù), resulting in the final model:\n\\[\n\\pi_{t} = \\beta_{0}+\\beta_{1}MA\\pi_{t-1}+\\beta_{2}\\pi_{t-4}+\\beta_{3}MA\\pi_{t-5}+\\beta_{4}(u_{t}+\\overline{u_{t}})\n\\] \\[\n+\\beta_{5}fe_{t}+\\beta_{6}fe_{t-1}+\\beta_{7}latefe_{t}+\\beta_{8}latefe_{t-1} \\label{eq:model2} \\tag{7}\n\\]\nUsing a sample period covering Q4 1974 to Q2 2013 and equation 7, I estimate inflation from Q4 1974 to Q2 2023.\n\n\n6 Results\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe results of the regression on the final model are included to the right:\n\nInterestingly, the regression on the initial model did not find the second or third lag of inflation to be significant but did find the fourth lag to be. According to the regression results an increase in the contemporaneous unemployment gap is associated with a decrease in the inflation of a given period, so the relationship between the two holds strong and is still inverse! Interestingly, although an increase in the contemporaneous food energy effect is associated with an increase in inflation, an increase in the prior period is associated with a decrease in inflation. This appears to reflect a kind of ‚Äúcooling‚Äù to inflation following spikes in food or energy prices in prior quarters. It is these latter kinds of effects that the triangle model captures, and the accelerationist curve does not is\n\n\n\n\n\nTable¬†7: Triangle Model Regression Table\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nperhaps why the former serves as a better model of inflation overall. To illustrate this, I plot the estimates of the model, including those that are simulated (e.g., periods that were not included in the sample, Q2 2013 to Q2 2023), displayed below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†7: Triangle Model Inflation Estimates\n\n\n\nHow could a dead curve be so accurate? While ‚Äúeyeballing‚Äù is not the most advanced kind of statistical analysis, it is clear that the model does well at its purpose.\n\n\n7 Conclusion\nThe Phillips curve is not dead, it is misspecified. Even without using short-run unemployment, which is better accoridng to Gordon (2013) for modern estimates, the triangle model provides accurate estimates for inflation, including for simulated periods. In his 1977 paper, Robert J. Gordon identified cost-push inflation, supply shocks, as a necessary component of any model trying to account for the stagflation of the 1970s and clearly he was on to something. Since then, he has updated his model every decade short of 2020. This is not a radical model, is it a better specification of a relationship identified 20 years earlier and it has been available for over half a century. To say the Phillips curve is dead is to ignore this and other attempts to better specify the relationship‚Äîconsider even a non-linear curve or one based in conflict theory.\n\nThis paper took the triangle model as specified by Gordon (2013) and updated it with more recent data. The results of this paper are in alignment with those of the former, finding that the triangle model is a strong method for modelling inflation and that by extension, the relationship first identified in the traditional curve must still hold some value. The major findings of this paper are that the unemployment gap and food energy effect are still significantly related to the inflation rate a decade on.\n\nThe traditional curve is dead‚Äîlong live the traditional curve‚Äîand the accelerationist curve is insufficient, but that does not mean that the relationship is not there or cannot still be considered in policy decisions. Instead, we just have to add in additional factors to account for supply shocks, as Gordon et al. (1977);Gordon (1981);Gordon (1997);Gordon (2013) does. Look no further than Jerome Powell‚Äôs attempts to increase unemployment to decrease inflation this very year. I doubt the Federal Reserve would be relying so much on a ‚Äúdead‚Äù idea.\n\n\n8 References\n\n\nGordon, Robert J. 1968. ‚ÄúThe Role of Monetary Policy.‚Äù American Economic Review 58 (3): 1‚Äì17. https://login.ezproxy.uvm.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/role-monetary-policy/docview/59405489/se-2.\n\n\n‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî. 1981. ‚ÄúInflation, Flexible Exchange Rates, and the Natural Rate of Unemployment.‚Äù https://doi.org/10.3386/w0708.\n\n\n‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî. 1997. ‚ÄúThe Time-Varying NAIRU and Its Implications for Economic Policy.‚Äù Journal of Economic Perspectives 11 (1): 11‚Äì32. https://doi.org/10.1257/jep.11.1.11.\n\n\n‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî. 2013. ‚ÄúThe Phillips Curve Is Alive and Well: Inflation and the NAIRU During the Slow Recovery.‚Äù https://doi.org/10.3386/w19390.\n\n\nGordon, Robert J., George Perry, Franco Modigliani, Arthur Okun, Michael Wachter, Pentti Kouri, Edmund Phelps, and Christopher Sims. 1977. ‚ÄúCan the Inflation of the 1970s Be Explained?‚Äù Brookings Papers on Economic Activity 1977 (1): 253. https://doi.org/10.2307/2534262.\n\n\nStaiger, Douglas, James H Stock, and Mark W Watson. 1997. ‚ÄúThe NAIRU, Unemployment and Monetary Policy.‚Äù Journal of Economic Perspectives 11 (1): 33‚Äì49. https://doi.org/10.1257/jep.11.1.33.\n\n\n\n\n9 Appendix\nDATA.R\nMODEL.R\nDataCleaned.csv\nDataComplete.csv\nGordonModelDataset.csv\nFirst_regression.png"

    "text": "1.1 Why Brexit?\nThe UK was one of the principal members of the EU by size and economic power. In the same class were only France, Germany, and perhaps Italy. Among these members‚Äîspecifically among France and Germany‚Äîthe UK was long least committed to the European project. The reasons for this vary but, as aptly summarized by writers Henley, Rankin, and O‚ÄôCarroll for The Guardian:\n\n[Britain has] a profound sense of exceptionalism, reinforced by relative economic success and an overwhelmingly Eurosceptic popular press [‚Ä¶] This eventually combined to create the impression that the EU was essentially an anti-British plot [‚Ä¶] Amid the bitter fallout of the financial crash, mounting public concern over immigration and a political threat from the right in the form of Nigel Farage‚Äôs anti-EU [UKIP] party led David Cameron to promise an in-out Brexit referendum if he won the 2015 election. A largely populist, emotive, and evidence-free campaign with the inspired slogan ‚ÄúTake back control‚Äù carried the day, with voters motivated by a wide range of factors opting by 52% to 48% in [favor] of the UK leaving the EU.\n-Henley, Rankin, and O‚ÄôCarroll (2020)\n\nThis is a familiar narrative for Americans. Following the 2008 financial crisis, right-wing populists gained a foothold in mainstream conversations. In the UK this growth of the populist right put the Conservative Cameron government in the understandably difficult position of doing something it may not have necessarily wanted to do but did in the hope of appealing to a growing voting segment. Understanding all the individual motivations for Brexit is not paramount to understanding its economic implications, but it is useful to have an idea of who was in charge when this happened."

    "section": "1.2 Economic Implications",
    "text": "1.2 Economic Implications\nAlthough the UK left the EU in February 2020, there was a transition period lasting until the end of the same year wherein the former remained within the common market. This means that analyses of the economic effects of Brexit really must begin in January 2021, after the transition period. There are two principal things I wish to consider in terms of changes to the British economy following Brexit‚Äîthe labor market, and price levels.\n\n1.2.1 Labor\nGiven the limited restrictions on intra-EU travel, and the relatively higher earnings in the UK when compared to some other member states the Isles had in fact long-benefited from EU migration currents. The UK did at the EU level what the US does at a global level‚Äîabsorb foreign labor looking for higher wages1. The severing of this connection created a new shortfall in labor, one that certainly was not appreciated when, a mere month later, pandemic restrictions were put into place. According to the Centre for European Reform, by June 2022 ‚Äú[‚Ä¶] there was a significant shortfall of around \\(460000\\) EU-origin workers, partly but not wholly compensated for by an increase of about \\(130000\\) non-EU workers‚Äù (Springford and Ports 2023). In other words, only a little more than a year after the end of the transition period, \\(300000\\) people who would have been in the UK and would have contributed their labor supply, were not there. The UK Office for National Statistics reports the employment level as over \\(30\\) million persons (Powell and Francis-Devine 2024), but that does not mean that this change is a drop in the bucket. Consider labor levels and growth as stocks and flows. Yes, the stock of labor within the UK is large now, but just as capital depreciates, individuals leave the labor force and must be replaced by inflows of new labor. The flow of labor to the UK was down by over \\(300000\\) persons the year after the Brexit transition ended.\n\nOne way to observe changes in labor market conditions is by simply looking at the unemployment rates. Declining unemployment indicates a tightening‚Äîrelative to the prior period‚Äîlabor market. Below is a graph of unemployment rates among the UK, France, Germany, Italy, and the EU average:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Rates\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Gaps\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†1: Unemployment\n\n\n\nThe shaded region in Figure¬†1 (a) represents the period from when pandemic lockdown restrictions in the UK were first implemented to when they were last lifted. This period is generally similar in many other European countries in terms of the timeline of restrictions. The dashed vertical lines represent, from left to right, the initial Brexit announcement and the end of the transition period. As can be seen, the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic led to large fluctuations in unemployment but, zooming in on the UK we still notice two things. First, the initial stage of Brexit (February 2020) had minimal impact‚Äîa slight uptick in unemployment was recorded following that change and quickly flattened at the beginning of the pandemic. This negligible result is understandable given that the UK still remained within the common market and travel area during this initial stage until the end of the transition period. Second, immediately following the end of the transition period there is a drop in unemployment‚Äîalbeit also very slight‚Äîfollowed by a more sustained drop thereafter mirroring all other groups with the adjustment to the pandemic era. This second change is slightly more significant as, in all other countries (including the EU average), unemployment either remained at parity with or slightly rose when compared to the preceding period. Whatever the case, it is clear that the early effects of Brexit are somewhat buried by the pandemic.\n\nOne problem with using the unemployment rate is that‚Äîalone‚Äîit does not indicate if a labor market is tight but only if it is tightening, as noted previously. This is because the constitutions of labor markets vary by place. A low unemployment rate in one region is not necessarily low in another. Instead, it is useful to assess labor market conditions across regions according to their respective ‚Äúnatural‚Äù rates. From this, we derive the unemployment gap. This indicator is the rate of unemployment, \\(U\\), less the natural rate of unemployment (NAIRU), \\(\\overline{U}\\), and it allows us to better assess the changes in labor markets in terms of their respective equilibrium levels of unemployment:\n\\[\n\\ddot{u} = u - \\overline{u} \\label{eq:eq_1} \\tag{1}\n\\]\nThe NAIRU can vary by country and through time, and the method for estimating the time-varying natural rate of unemployment (TV-NAIRU) is described later in Section¬†3.2.1. Looking at the unemployment gap, a very similar story emerges. The shaded region in Figure¬†1 (b) represents the period from when pandemic lockdown restrictions in the UK were first implemented to when they were last lifted. The unemployment gap fell in the UK in the period immediately following the end of the transition period. Needless to say, there is something different about the composition of the UK labor market following its exit from the common market and travel area.\n\nThe effects of the pandemic on labor markets were complicated, and it is clear that labor tightening occurred just about everywhere during the pandemic recovery, but it is also clear the UK had a uniquely sharp and sustained tightening.\n\n\n1.2.2 Prices\nAlongside changes to the labor market was an inflation spike that rocked the UK in the latter half of 2021. While inflation, like labor tightening, struck all included, it is worth investigating the role of Brexit. Below is a series of figures detailing inflation across the five entities of interest:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Headline\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Core\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) Energy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(d) Food\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†2: Inflation\n\n\n\n\nAs seen in Figure¬†2, while the addition of food-energy inflation results in a less eye-catching display, the absence of those two price-shocks in Figure¬†2 (b) shows inflation in to be higher in the UK than all but the EU average past mid-2021. Adam Posen, a former Monetary Policy Committee member at the Bank of England, and Lucas Rengifo-Keller attribute this to Brexit, writing:\n\nBy ending the free movement of EU migrant workers to the UK, the UK government has unilaterally cut the labor supply and its elasticity. By adding new tariff and nontariff trade barriers, the British government has slashed purchasing power and available imports, and it has created inflation during the staggered implementation of the Brexit deal.\n-Posen and Rengifo-Keller (2016)\n\nWith the exit from the common market, the UK faced higher barriers to trade with its continental neighbors than before. It reasons that higher costs would incur higher price levels. It similarly reasons to say that energy inflation resulted from the onset of the Russo-Ukrainian war and thus was more damaging to continental importers‚Äîthe timelines match up fairly well. Additionally, the tightening of the labor market outlined in Section¬†1.2.1 likely resulted in wage inflation, which, as Posen and Rengifo-Keller (2016) pointed out: was higher than in France and Germany.\n\nUpon review of labor and prices in the UK during this period, it is clear that Brexit had an effect, albeit one that is obfuscated by the pandemic. Now two questions remain. First, can a traditional model of inflation still accurately fit the huge shocks of this period? Second, what specifically was most structurally affected by these two things in terms of labor and prices, and can it account for the difference?"

This simple curve proved to be a somewhat useful, imperfect, guide for macroeconomic policy.

    "text": "2.2 Gordon‚Äôs Triangle\nResponding to the stagflation of the 1970s, Robert J. Gordon developed a model of inflation that described overall inflation as the result of three forces: inertia, demand, and supply Inertia represents so-called underlying inflation, which amounts in model implementations to lags of the rate of inflation. Demand reflects an ‚Äú[‚Ä¶] index of excess demand‚Äù (Gordon 1997), which is labor market tightness. Lastly, supply concerns price shocks like food or energy inflation. Inertia and supply merely require other rates of inflation, but demand requires a measure of labor market tightness. While the unemployment rate may appear an appealing choice, as noted in Section¬†1.2.1, there are problems with using it to gauge this tightness. Instead, it is more useful to again focus on the unemployment gap seen in Equation \\(\\eqref{eq:eq_1}\\).\n\nThe unemployment gap allows us to better assess the changes in labor markets in terms of their respective equilibrium levels of unemployment. However, its estimation also requires an estimation of the natural rate, which will be seen in Section¬†3.2.1.\nIn his 2013 working paper, Gordon uses the model to assess the continued presence of the Phillips curve relationship in modeling inflation by taking data over a period of decades and observing how the model responds, concluding that‚Äîat least as of then‚Äîthe relationship continued to exist (Gordon 2013), and that his model remains robust.\n\nI follow a variation of this model, and again aim to demonstrate its robustness, however I aim to do so across a different time period including perhaps even greater variation in the indicators used in the regression."

While unemployment increased during the pandemic period, the authors project it to decrease and follow that trend in the years to come, which, in addition to research by Springford and Ports (2023), may reflect labor market tightness attributable to a post-Brexit immigration environment in the United Kingdom.\n\nKnowing already that these are the likely effects of Brexit given this work and the analysis in Section¬†1.2, I intend rather to investigate if the Gordon model described above in Section¬†2.2 can adequately account for these changes and what specific structural change‚Äîif any‚Äîis most responsible for the changes to the British economy in this period."

    "text": "3.1 Data and Methodology\nAll data is sourced from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), with monthly time series observations from January 2007 to June 2023 for 26 groups at the national level. I collect data on as many EU (or in the case of the UK, former EU) members as are available from the OECD alongside the EU member-state average‚Äîalthough I do not use this average in my models. Headline, core, food, and energy inflation are all from ‚ÄúInflation (CPI)‚Äù (2017). Unemployment rates are from ‚ÄúHarmonised Unemployment Rate (HUR)‚Äù (2017). All data cleaning and modeling is done in R.\n\nAll data is measured as percent rates, with inflation being the percent change in consumer price levels between years and unemployment being the proportion of persons in the labor force but not working within a given country. To identify Brexit and the pandemic, I create dummy variables \\(\\text{BREXITnumeric}\\) and \\(\\text{COVIDnumeric}\\) respectively. Additionally, I create a third dummy to identify the UK exclusively among other countries, \\(\\text{isUKnumeric}\\). The conditions for the three dummies are as follows (in the order that they were presented):\n\nBefore January 2021 \\(\\text{BREXITnumeric}=0\\), after \\(\\text{BREXITnumeric}=1\\). I choose January 2021 because that is the date of the end of the transition period, officially ending the association of the UK as part of the EU common market.\nBefore March 2020 or after February 2022 \\(\\text{COVIDnumeric}=0\\), otherwise \\(\\text{COVIDnumeric}=1\\). I chose March 2020 and February 2022 because those are the dates of the first and last lockdowns in the UK‚Äîwhich I use to demarcate the pandemic era for all countries studied since these periods were generally similar across Europe.\nIf a country in the dataset is not the UK \\(\\text{isUKnumeric}=0\\), otherwise \\(\\text{isUKnumeric}=1\\).\n\nAll groups studied are treated with the Brexit dummy but only the UK ever has \\(text{is_UK_numeric}=1\\), and I have observations for all groups before, during, and after the pandemic and for before and after Brexit. The total number of observations for this period is 5148, meaning that there are 198 observations per entity.\n\nTo answer my questions of interest I will implement a variation of the Gordon model using the data described above. To do this I will need to also estimate a TV-NAIRU, which unfortunately cuts down the period of usable data to December 2015 to October 2022. This is further explained in the next section Section¬†3.2.1. The table below shows the final list of variables for all groups over a period from December 2015 to October 2022:\n\nVariables\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\\(C\\pi\\)\nCore Inflation\n\n\n\\(E\\pi\\)\nEnergy Inflation\n\n\n\\(F\\pi\\)\nFood Inflation\n\n\n\\(H\\pi\\)\nHeadline Inflation\n\n\n\\(\\overline{H\\pi}\\)\nHeadline Inflation Moving Average\n\n\n\\(u\\)\nUnemployment Rate\n\n\n\\(\\overline{u}\\)\nNatural Rate of Unemployment\n\n\n\\(\\ddot{u}\\)\nUnemployment Gap\n\n\n\\(\\text{BREXITnumeric}\\)\nConditional dummy for Brexit treatment\n\n\n\\(\\text{COVIDnumeric}\\)\nConditional dummy for pandemic time period\n\n\n\\(\\text{isUKnumeric}\\)\nConditional dummy for if a country in the dataset is the United Kingdom\n\n\n\nAdditionally, I do not include the EU average in my NAIRU estimates as it would be redundant given how many EU member states I already have included. In all, I end with \\(25\\) countries, and \\(2075\\) observations‚Äî\\(83\\) observations per country‚Äîso things should be fine in terms of data.\n\nTo test the robustness of the Gordon model, I will construct a simple variation of it and calibrate it with data up to February 2020‚Äîbefore Brexit and the pandemic lockdowns. I will then feed it all the data I have available, resulting in a fitted line for data before February 2020, and a simulated line for the period thereafter. For the structural changes I will construct a naive country-based fixed-effects model and feed it the model all available data (how else would the Brexit and pandemic dummy variables work) and check for significant interaction terms. I will then add individual or like pairs of regressors from the Gordon model as if they were controls to see if their presence upends the significance of those interaction terms. Each control that does such will be recorded."

From Staiger, Stock, and Watson (1997), consider a quarterly model wherein core inflation is regressed on four lags of the unemployment rate:\n\\[\nC\\pi_{t} = \\beta_{0}+\\beta_{1}u_{t-1}+\\beta_{2}u_{t-2}+\\beta_{3}u_{t-3}+\\beta_{4}u_{t-4} \\label{eq:eq_NAIRU1} \\tag{2}\n\\]\nFrom Equation \\(\\eqref{eq:eq_NAIRU1}\\) the NAIRU would be derived by:\n\\[\n\\overline{u} = \\frac{\\beta_{0}}{\\beta_{1}+\\beta_{2}+\\beta_{3}+\\beta_{4}} \\label{eq:eq_NAIRU2} \\tag{3}\n\\]\nFour lags of unemployment are used for quarterly data in Staiger, Stock, and Watson (1997), so I use twelve for monthly data:\n\\[\n\\overline{u} = \\frac{\\beta_{0}}{\\beta_{1}+\\beta_{2}+\\beta_{3}+\\beta_{4}+\\beta_{5}+\\beta_{6}+\\beta_{7}+\\beta_{8}+\\beta_{9}+\\beta_{10}+\\beta_{11}+\\beta_{12}} \\label{eq:eq_NAIRU3} \\tag{4}\n\\]\nStaiger, Stock, and Watson (1997) go on to use a complex cubic spline, so instead I just run a rolling regression and smooth it with a Hodrick-Prescott filter set to \\(\\lambda = 14400\\). This rolling average regression method results in some observations being lost due to the window of observations per average. The window needs to be sufficiently large while also leaving room for the average to change. I use a window period of \\(99\\) which evenly divides the total dataset, but unfortunately still leads to the first years being lost as the first \\(99\\) periods per entity are averaged for the first step of the rolling average. Additionally, once I have the TV-NAIRU estimates, I shift the estimates down to match with other variable observations per month. This results in the last few months being lost. Still, I have over \\(2000\\) observations for \\(25\\) countries as noted in Section¬†3.1.\n\n\n3.2.2 Gordon‚Äôs Triangle\nNow armed with a TV-NAIRU estimate for each country, the triangle can be implemented. For my implementation of the model, I follow a reduced version of Gordon (2013). In that paper, Gordon essentially throws the kitchen sink at the problem: inflation is lagged \\(24\\) times, with moving averages interspersed every \\(4\\) lags, and all other variables are similarly lagged at least \\(4\\) times each. This was for quarterly data, if I were to replicate this method for monthly data I would have \\(72\\) lags of inflation alone‚ÄîI am not doing. Rather, I choose to focus on a much narrower set of lags. For my implementation, I lag inflation \\(3\\) times, with the first (\\(1\\) month) and last lag (\\(13\\) months) being a moving average like in Gordon (2013). All other variables include \\(1\\) lag alongside a contemporaneous (unlagged) observation. This model implementation appears as follows:\n\\[\n\\scriptsize H\\pi_{n}=\\beta_{0}+\\beta_{1}MA\\pi_{n-1}+\\beta_{2}\\pi_{n-2}+\\beta_{3}MA\\pi_{n-13}+\n\\] \\[\n\\scriptsize\\beta_{4}E\\pi_{(n)}+\\beta_{5}F\\pi_{(n)}+\n\\] \\[\n\\scriptsize \\beta_{6}E\\pi_{(n-1)}+\\beta_{7}F\\pi_{(n-1)}+\\beta_{8}\\ddot{u}_{n}+\\beta_{9}\\ddot{u}_{n-1} \\label{eq:eq_Gordon} \\tag{5}\n\\]\n\n\n3.2.3 A Naive Model of Inflation\nThe last part of this escapade is the naive difference-in-differences model. It is called naive because it is just a country-based fixed effects model with dummies for Brexit and the pandemic. The model is constructed as follows:\n\\[\n\\scriptsize H\\pi_{n}= \\beta_{0}+\\beta_{1}Country+\\beta_{2}\\text{COVIDnumeric}+\\beta_{3}\\text{isUKnumeric} \\times \\text{COVIDnumeric} +\n\\] \\[\n\\scriptsize \\beta_{4}\\text{BREXITnumeric}+\\beta_{5}\\text{isUKnumeric} \\times \\text{BREXITnumeric}+\n\\] \\[\n\\scriptsize \\beta_{6}\\text{BREXITnumeric} \\times \\text{COVIDnumeric}+\n\\] \\[\n\\scriptsize \\beta_{7}\\text{isUKnumeric} \\times \\text{BREXITnumeric} \\times \\text{COVIDnumeric} \\label{eq:eq_naive} \\tag{6}\n\\]\nThe interaction terms detail the effect of Brexit and the pandemic on the UK in particular. Individual or like pairs of regressors from Equation \\(\\eqref{eq:eq_Gordon}\\) are added to Equation \\(\\eqref{eq:eq_naive}\\) to assess the structural effects of Brexit and the pandemic. An example of such an addition is:\n\\[\n\\scriptsize H\\pi_{n}= \\alpha_{0}\\ddot{u}_{n} + \\alpha_{1}\\ddot{u}_{n-1} +\n\\] \\[\n\\scriptsize \\beta_{0}+\\beta_{1}Country+\\beta_{2}\\text{COVIDnumeric}+\\beta_{3}\\text{isUKnumeric} \\times \\text{COVIDnumeric}+\n\\] \\[\n\\scriptsize \\beta_{4}\\text{BREXITnumeric}+\\beta_{5}\\text{isUKnumeric} \\times \\text{BREXITnumeric}+\n\\] \\[\n\\scriptsize \\beta_{6}\\text{BREXITnumeric} \\times \\text{COVIDnumeric}+\n\\] \\[\n\\scriptsize \\beta_{7}\\text{isUKnumeric} \\times \\text{BREXITnumeric} \\times \\text{COVIDnumeric} \\label{eq:eq_naive1} \\tag{7}\n\\]\nIn the above example, the contemporaneous and lagged unemployment gaps are added."

The fact that the contemporaneous and lagged unemployment gap cancel each other other implies that as well. Lastly, this may be a flaw in my TV-NAIRU estimation method, as the TV-NAIRUs for each of the countries included varies significantly. In the case of the UK, it is known that their core inflation shot past continental Europe during the pandemic recovery. Given that the TV-NAIRU is estimated by a regression on core inflation, such changes should be kept in mind when looking at the results of the unemployment gap. Whatever the case, the model clearly does well, explaining about \\(92.4\\%\\) of the variation in headline inflation and doing so without even having to throw one hundred regressors at it. Moreover, the signs of the coefficients are in line with previous works (Gordon et al. 1977; Gordon 1981, 1997, 2013). The results show that food price shocks in particular had a large (almost \\(0.2\\) point) impact on headline inflation. The figure below further demonstrates the strength of the model:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†3: Gordon Model\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough ‚Äúeyeballing it‚Äù is not the most surefire method of checking for result validity, I struggle to think that a model that produces such a figure as is seen above would be poor at estimating inflation. There is a slight overestimation near the tail-end though, which is worthy of note and is in fact related to the results of my second question in Section¬†4.2, where it is further explained."

All regressors return significant coefficients. In particular, \\(brexitnumeric\\), the triple interaction, and the intercept are the only positive coefficients (excluding country-based fixed-effects where there is variation among countries). This implies that the pandemic had a deflationary effect while Brexit had an inflationary one.\n\nIncluding a table per adjusted variable would manifest as a bunch of extremely long tables and another \\(10\\) pages. In short, with \\(MA\\pi_{n-1}\\) the triple interaction is no longer significant but the others are. With \\(\\pi_{n-2}\\) and \\(MA\\pi_{n-13}\\) all are still significant. With all three paired the result is the same as with \\(MA\\pi_{n-1}\\) alone. With \\(E\\pi_{n}\\) or \\(E\\pi_{n-1}\\) or the two paired together all are still significant. With \\(F\\pi_{n}\\) only the UK-Brexit interaction term remains significant. With \\(F\\pi_{n-1}\\) all remain significant. With the two paired the result is the same as with just \\(F\\pi_{n}\\). With \\(\\ddot{u}_{n}\\) or \\(\\ddot{u}_{n-1}\\) or the two paired together all are still significant. Whatever the change (other than the unemployment gap), any added regressor is significant. It is clear then that while the changes of Brexit specifically in the UK outside of the pandemic era remain unexplained by these individual controls, including food price inflation explains much of the variation during the pandemic in the UK. The figure below illustrates the difference between the initial naive model estimation and the same model after contemporaneous food inflation and its one-period lag are added:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Initial\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Model with Food Inflation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†4: Naive Model Comparison\n\n\n\nFirst of all, it is clear from Figure¬†4 that even just including food inflation drastically improves the model. Second, something that may be fairly noticeable in Figure¬†4 (b) is that the predicted value of inflation again begins to overshoot near the end of the observational period. This is the same as what happened earlier in Section¬†4.1! While it would of course be preferred that the Gordon model in Figure¬†3 did not see this, its presence here is instead rather welcome, illustrating the role that food price level inflation may be playing in overestimating inflation in the Gordon model for that period. In the case of Figure¬†3, I would wager that inertia is not fully accounted for in that period as it is so close to the end of the observational period‚Äîwere there more observations, the estimation would eventually return following the path of actual reports of inflation. Either way, these results show that through Brexit and the pandemic arose a structural change in the British economy around food pricing‚Äîrather than Brexit and the pandemic increasing inflation by their own existence‚Äîand this change underlies a notable portion of inflation in the UK during this period."

    "section": "2.1 Theoretical Model",
    "text": "2.1 Theoretical Model\nA theoretical model describes complex economic processes in simplified terms. Theoretical models do not aim to be perfect representations of an economy but aim to illustrate important relationships. The RCK growth model builds on microeconomic foundations, representing consumption-saving behavior by households and their interactions with firms in a dynamic environment (Cass 1965; Koopmans 1963). I consider the model without debt and deficits but with lump-sum taxes. In the model, households supply their labor and capital to firms in exchange for wages and rents (household income). Additionally, the government provides services for households with revenues raised via their taxing. The money households earn in income (less the amount paid in taxes) is then either put towards consumption‚Äîin the contemporaneous period‚Äîof the output goods and services produced by those firms or, is saved for consumption of those goods and services in a future period. Table¬†1 below defines the variables of the theoretical model presented in the next subsections:\n\n\n\nTable¬†1: Model Variables\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\text{Variable}\\)\n\\(~~~~~\\text{Description}~~~\\)\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\alpha\\)\nContribution of Capital to Output (\\(\\alpha&lt;1\\))\n\n\n\\(\\theta\\)\nCoefficient of Relative Risk Aversion (the preferences of individuals to ‚Äúrisk‚Äù their incomes towards consumption)\n\n\n\\(\\rho\\)\nRate of Time Preference (the reward for consuming in the immediate period)\n\n\n\\(r\\)\nInterest Rate (the reward for saving)\n\n\n\\(n\\)\nPopulation Growth Rate\n\n\n\\(g\\)\nGrowth Rate of Technological Progress\n\n\n\\(k\\)\nCapital Accumulation\n\n\n\\(w\\)\nWages\n\n\n\\(K\\)\nCapital Stock\n\n\n\\(L\\)\nLabor\n\n\n\\(A\\)\nEffectiveness of Factors of Production (Capital and Labor)\n\n\n\\(T\\)\nTaxes\n\n\n\\(G\\)\nGovernment Expenditure\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1.1 Firms\nThe production function of this model is a Cobb-Douglas function where firms operate under perfect competition. The production function is expressed in its intensive form:\n\\[\nY=F(\\frac{K}{AL},1) = f(k) = k^{\\alpha} \\label{eq:class_eq_1} \\tag{1}\n\\]\nProfit maximization yields the optimality conditions for wages and the interest rate:\n\\[\nr = f'(k) \\label{eq:class_eq_2} \\tag{2}\n\\]\n\\[\nw = f(k)-k(f'(k)) \\label{eq:class_eq_3} \\tag{3}\n\\]\n\\(\\eqref{eq:class_eq_2}\\) and \\(\\eqref{eq:class_eq_3}\\) indicate that the interest and wage rates correspond to the marginal product of capital and labor respectively.\n\n\n\n2.1.2 Households\nHouseholds make decisions to save or consume, considering future periods as well as the present, and their consumption-saving behavior is characterized by constrained utility maximization. Households want to maximize their utility across periods and into the future according to their risk and rate of time preferences. The coefficient of relative risk aversion defines the risk preferences of households and is expressed as:\n\\[\n\\theta=\\frac{-c(u''(c))}{u'(c)} \\label{eq:class_eq_4} \\tag{4}\n\\]\nThe constant relative risk aversion (CRRA) utility function takes this coefficient:\n\\[\nu(c(t))=\\frac{c(t)^{1-\\theta}}{1-\\theta} \\label{eq:class_eq_5} \\tag{5}\n\\]\ndefining utility according to consumption and risk preferences. Lastly, households maximize their utility according to the CRRA and their rate of time preference:\n\\[\n\\max{U} = \\int_{t=0}^{\\infty}e^{-\\rho{t}}u(c(t)) dt \\label{eq:class_eq_6} \\tag{6}\n\\]\nThe rate of time preference, \\(\\rho\\), illustrates the preferences of households for consuming more in the immediate period. In other words, it is the premium for impatience. While maximizing their utility, households face a dynamic budget constraint:\n\\[\n\\dot{k}=(r(t)-n-g)k(t)+w(t)-c(t)-T(t) \\label{eq:class_eq_7} \\tag{7}\n\\]\nwhich constrains their utility according to how much they can afford, as well as the no-Ponzi-game constraint (Friedman 1957), which restricts households from taking an infinite stream of rolling debt to pay off prior debts. The solution to the problem households face is found via applying the maximum principle on the Hamiltonian function:\n\\[\n\\mathscr{H}=\\frac{c(t)^{1-\\theta}}{1-\\theta}+\\lambda(t)[r(t)-(n+g)k(t)+w(t)-c(t)] \\label{eq:class_eq_8} \\tag{8}\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\lambda(t)\\) is marginal utility of consumption. Following the maximum principle, the optimality conditions for households:\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathscr{H}(t)}{\\partial c(t)}=0 \\label{eq:class_eq_9} \\tag{9}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathscr{H}(t)}{\\partial k(t)}=\\beta\\lambda(t)-\\dot{\\lambda}(t) \\label{eq:class_eq_10} \\tag{10}\n\\]\nalongside these two is a third, the transversality condition:\n\\[\ne^{-\\beta{t}}\\lambda(t)k(t)=0 \\label{eq:class_eq_11} \\tag{11}\n\\]\nwhich says that all capital saved should be put towards consumption by death since individuals can increase utility by increasing consumption (decreasing marginal utility \\(\\lambda\\)) within their lifetimes. In other words, there is no point in saving money you cannot use.\n\nCombining Equations \\(\\eqref{eq:class_eq_9}\\) and \\(\\eqref{eq:class_eq_10}\\) yields the intertemporal allocation of consumption also called the Keynes-Ramsey rule or Euler equation, which describes how households allocate for consumption over time. In per effective worker terms, the Euler equation is:\n\\[\n{\\dot{c} \\over c}(t)=\\frac{1}{\\theta}[r(t)-\\rho-\\theta{(n+g)}] \\label{eq:class_eq_12} \\tag{12}\n\\]\nwhere \\({1 \\over \\theta}\\) represents the elasticity of intertemporal substitution, which describes how much individuals are willing to reallocate consumption across periods of time‚Äîand thus how quickly households adjust to new equilibria. A low coefficient of relative risk aversion means a high elasticity of intertemporal substitution, which means that an individual is more willing to reallocate consumption from the present to the future.\n\n\n\n2.1.3 Government and General Equilibrium\nIn this implementation of the RCK model, government spending, \\(G(t)\\), is financed by lump-sum taxes, \\(T(t)\\):\n\\[\nG(t) = T(t) \\label{eq:class_eq_13} \\tag{13}\n\\]\nThe goods market equilibrium‚Äînational accounts identity‚Äîcloses the model:\n\\[\nY(t)=C(t)+I(t)+G(t) \\label{eq:class_eq_14} \\tag{14}\n\\]\nBy Walras‚Äôs law, since the capital and labor markets are in equilibrium, the goods market is also in equilibrium."

In the transition between the loci, as seen in arrows on Figure¬†1, consumption initially spikes in the short-run at \\(t=0\\) and then drops alongside capital accumulation, in the long run, following the red-colored saddle path of the first locus towards that of the second."

    "text": "3.1 Data Description\nI source most data on the Bosnian economy from the section covering Bosnia (ordered by country code as ‚ÄúBIH‚Äù) in the Penn World Table (Groningen Growth And Development Centre 2023). The data is annual, and observations in the Penn World Table for Bosnia begin in the year 1990 and end in the year 2019. For my data, I am only looking at the period from 1996 to 2007 for the initial steady state, and then the year 2008 for the change in risk aversion, \\(\\theta\\). Data on GDP, \\(Y\\), is recorded annually in millions at current purchasing power parity (PPP) of 2017 U.S. Dollars (USD). Data on consumption (\\(C\\)), investment (\\(I\\)), government spending (\\(G\\)), and net exports (\\(Nx\\)), are recorded as decimal shares of GDP that add to one for each year. Consumption as a share of GDP in the Penn World Table includes consumption of both domestic- and foreign-produced goods meaning that the value includes the share from imports, so although my model does not include net exports, I include it in Table¬†2 to show that the sum of GDP shares add to 1. Data on capital stock, \\(K\\), is recorded annually at current PPP of 2017 USD. Data on the labor share of GDP (\\(wN \\over Y\\)) is recorded annually. Additional data is collected from the World Bank. Data on the population growth rate, \\(n\\), is collected from a dataset covering global population growth rates (World Bank 2023). Data on the interest rate, \\(r\\), is collected from the series on deposit interest rates (World Bank 2024a). The data on the interest rate for Bosnia only began recording observations in 2002. Similarly, data on the tax rate is collected from the series on tax revenue as a percent share of GDP (World Bank 2024c). As with the interest rate, data in the World Bank series only begins recording observations very recently, with the first being in 2005‚Äîonly three years to use for the average prior to the 2008 crisis.

    "section": "3.2 Parameters and Model Economy",
    "text": "3.2 Parameters and Model Economy\n\n3.2.1 Parameters for the Initial Economy\nI first find the average values for consumption, investment, government expenditure, net exports, and labor as a share of GDP over the 11-year period from 1996 (the first year after the Bosnian War) to 2007 (the last year before the 2008 crisis). These values are the representation of the initial steady state for the actual economy.\nI derive my initial parameters from those macroeconomic ratios and the equations of the model. The equilibrium condition for the wage rate described in Section¬†2.1.1 gives the following formula for \\(\\alpha\\):\n\\[\n\\alpha=1-\\frac{wN}{Y} \\label{eq:class_eq_19} \\tag{19}\n\\]\nwhich solves for \\(\\alpha\\), the contribution of capital to output according to the contribution of labor to output. I solve for its value using the average of \\(wN \\over Y\\) over a period from 1996 to 2007 and choose a value slightly below the solution. I choose a value below the solution, \\(\\alpha = {1 \\over 3}\\) so that Wolfram Mathematica cooperates. For \\(n\\) (the population growth rate), I take the average growth rate of the population over a period from 1996 to 2007 using World Bank data. The data on population growth is heavily skewed by the war in the 1990s with a positive average prior to 2008. In reality, the population has been steadily declining for decades and there are 1 million fewer persons in Bosnia today than in 1996. The reason that the average value for \\(n\\) prior to 2008 is positive is because the World Bank data asserts that the growth rate of the Bosnian population was \\(4\\%\\) in 1996. This I believe to be from repatriations and better record-keeping post-war. The Penn World Table offers population data as well (Groningen Growth And Development Centre 2023), but using that instead would result in problems that I will detail later. For \\(g\\) (the growth rate of technological progress), I take the average of the change in total factor productivity from 2002 to 2007. For \\(T \\over Y\\) (the exogenous ratio of taxes to output), I take the average tax revenue as a percentage of GDP from 2005 to 2007. It is assumed in the model that government taxation equals government expenditure, \\(G\\). For \\(\\rho\\) (the rate of time preference), I take the average deposit rate, r, over a period from 2002 to 2007 to calibrate the rate of time preference. I take an average because I want to know what the deposit rate generally was in the period prior to 2008. The rate of time preference is a parameter within the continuous function seen in Equation \\(\\eqref{eq:class_eq_6}\\) that can be related to the interest rate (a discrete-time variable). More specifically, if the interest rate is the price of time passing, the rate of time preference is the discount for getting things immediately. If the interest rate is higher, individuals place a greater discount on immediate prices.\n\nFor the initial coefficient of relative risk aversion, I take the estimate of \\(\\theta = 0.72\\) found by authors G√°ndelman and Hern√°ndez-Murillo (2015). This estimate is in line with those of similar middle-income countries from the paper in the same period. Additionally, the average value for the rate of time preference (\\(\\rho=0.03776\\)) obtained using the deposit interest rate is comparable to that (\\(\\rho=0.03678\\)) which is achieved using a formula based on the Euler equation expressed in the steady state. This formula is expressed as:\n\\[\n\\theta=\\frac{(r-\\rho)}{(n+g)} \\label{eq:class_eq_20} \\tag{20}\n\\]\nand is rewritten to solve for the rate of time preference, with the average (prior to 2008) values of the deposit interest rate, population growth rate, and growth rate of technological progress alongside \\(\\theta = 0.72\\) plugged in:\n\\[\n\\rho = r - \\theta(n + g) \\label{eq:class_eq_21} \\tag{21}\n\\]\nAs noted previously, the rate of time preference illustrates the preferences of households for consuming more in the immediate period. Equation \\(\\eqref{eq:class_eq_20}\\) describes risk aversion in terms that include the rate of time preference subtracting the interest rate. Rewriting this, Equation \\(\\eqref{eq:class_eq_21}\\) describes the rate of time preference in terms of risk aversion‚Äîadjusted by the growth rates of population and technological progress‚Äîsubtracting from the interest rate. The higher the interest rate or lower the coefficient of relative risk aversion, the higher the rate of time preference‚Äîthe premium for getting things sooner is higher when you are less concerned about risks. Of course, it is worth recalling that the rate of time preference is also a function of the interest rate alone. The resulting values from each method are close, which further evidences this to be a reasonable estimate for the initial coefficient of relative risk aversion.\n\nIn the steady state, my model underestimates the ratio of consumption, (greatly underestimates) investment and government expenditure to output:\n\n\n\nTable¬†2: Actual versus Model Economy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBosnia\n\\(~~~~~\\frac{C}{Y}~~~\\)\n\\(~~~~~\\frac{I}{Y}~~~\\)\n\\(~~~~~\\frac{G}{Y}~~~\\)\n\\(~~~~~\\frac{Nx}{Y}~~~\\)\n\n\n\n\nActual Economy\n\\(~~~~0.8390~~~\\)\n\\(~~~~0.2151~~~\\)\n\\(~~~~0.2546~~~\\)\n\\(-0.3024~~~\\)\n\n\nModel Economy\n\\(~~~~0.7704~~~\\)\n\\(~~~~0.0197~~~\\)\n\\(~~~~0.2099~~~\\)\n\\(~~~~0~~~\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is worth noting that a significant part of the Bosnian economy is constituted by imports that are not included in this model because it is a closed economy model. This discrepancy leads to the extremely low result for the level of investment in the model economy. We will see however that the dynamic response is more in line with what should be expected. In terms of national accounts, investment is solved for by taking the following difference:\n\\[\nI = Y - C - G - Nx \\label{eq:class_eq_22} \\tag{22}\n\\]\nand in the closed economy model \\(Nx=0\\):\n\\[\nI = Y - C - G \\label{eq:class_eq_23} \\tag{23}\n\\]\nEquation \\(\\eqref{eq:class_eq_23}\\) should look familiar, as it is the same as the goods market equilibrium from Equation \\(\\eqref{eq:class_eq_14}\\) shown in Section¬†2.1.3. The issue of the level of investment being underestimated cannot be solved by tweaking other parameters, the model is missing a piece of the puzzle‚Äînet exports. Any gains would only go to consumption since investment acts as a residual of output not used towards consumption. For example, because \\(T=G\\) in the model, it may be assumed from Equation \\(\\eqref{eq:class_eq_23}\\) that a lower value of the exogenous tax ratio parameter (\\(T \\over Y\\)) would lead to higher investment. However, this would ignore that consumption is still solved for first‚Äîsimultaneously with capital accumulation‚Äîand would increase following a decrease in the tax ratio. This means that, in the model, consumption would assume all the gain from a cut in taxes before investment gets the chance to see any of it. Below is a table displaying the steady state were the tax ratio set to \\({T \\over Y}=0\\):\n\n\n\nTable¬†3: Actual versus Model Economy (No-Tax Example)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBosnia\n\\(~~~~~\\frac{C}{Y}~~~\\)\n\\(~~~~~\\frac{I}{Y}~~~\\)\n\\(~~~~~\\frac{G}{Y}~~~\\)\n\\(~~~~~\\frac{Nx}{Y}~~~\\)\n\n\n\n\nActual Economy\n\\(~~~~0.8390~~~\\)\n\\(~~~~0.2151~~~\\)\n\\(~~~~0.2546~~~\\)\n\\(-0.3024~~~\\)\n\n\nModel Economy\n\\(~~~~0.9803~~~\\)\n\\(~~~~0.0197~~~\\)\n\\(~~~~0~~~\\)\n\\(~~~~0~~~\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs seen in Table¬†3, the resulting share of investment within the model economy is identical to the share found in Table¬†2, and all gains from the tax cut go to consumption.\nWhatever the case, my model estimates the share of consumption in the Bosnian economy quite well, and I move forward with it despite the underestimation of investment. In my dynamic results and sensitivity analysis sections, I will demonstrate that my results are still robust despite this underestimation. Below is the table of parameters for the model presented in the next three subsections:\n\nParameters\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(~~~~~\\alpha~~~\\)\n\\(~~~~~\\theta~~~\\)\n\\(~~~~~\\rho~~~\\)\n\\(~~~~~n~~~\\)\n\\(~~~~~g~~~\\)\n\\(~~~~~{T \\over Y}~~~\\)\n\n\n\n\n\\(~~~~{1 \\over 3}~~~\\)\n\\(~~~~0.72~~~\\)\n\\(~~~~0.03776~~~\\)\n\\(~~~~0.00553~~~\\)\n\\(-0.00320~~~\\)\n\\(~~~~0.20990~~~\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2.2 Estimation of Change in Risk Aversion Between Steady States\nBetween steady states, I will be adjusting the value for \\(\\theta\\) to reflect the change in risk aversion. I was unable to similarly find an estimate for Bosnia or a like country immediately following the Global Financial Crisis, meaning that I had to arrive at my own estimation for \\(\\theta\\) for that period. Authors G√°ndelman and Hern√°ndez-Murillo (2015) derived their value (\\(\\theta=0.72\\)) using 2006 Gallup World Poll data and regressing a logarithmic risk utility function2 (\\(g\\)) on individual self-reports of happiness (\\(h\\)), income (\\(y\\)), and a series of controls (\\(x\\)) with the following model:\n\\[\ng(y)=\\begin{cases}\n\\frac{y^{1-\\theta}-1}{1-\\theta} \\text{ if } \\theta \\ne 1\\\\\n\\log(y) \\text{ if } \\theta=1\n\\end{cases} \\label{eq:HappyPaper1} \\tag{24}\n\\]\n\\[\nh_{i} = \\alpha + \\gamma{g(y_{i})}+x_{i}\\beta+v_{i} \\label{eq:HappyPaper2} \\tag{25}\n\\]\nWhile I would have liked to replicate this methodology given that it produces sound estimates, using Gallup World Poll data was not an option due to the cost involved. Instead, I attempt three different methods of estimation for \\(\\theta\\) in the second period, and I will detail each and their results.\n\nThe first method involves solving for \\(\\theta\\) using Equation \\(\\eqref{eq:class_eq_20}\\) with values of the interest and population growth rates, and the growth rate of technological progress, updated for the year 2008. As noted earlier, the population growth rate is positive if derived from the World Bank, and negative if from the Penn World Table over the 1996 to 2007 period. Although the latter appears more reasonable on the surface, \\(g\\) is also negative, and if both \\(n\\) and \\(g\\) are negative, the Equation \\(\\eqref{eq:class_eq_20}\\) returns very wonky (negative) estimates. So, while I acknowledge the real population growth may be negative (although it is fair to say that the conditions of the war make basically any estimate from the era difficult), I cannot use a negative value in the model. Further, \\(g\\) cannot reasonably be made positive for argument‚Äôs sake after being consistently negative for 2008 and the years immediately prior. I therefore resolve to use the averages of \\(n\\) and \\(g\\) for the period 1996 to 2008 to account for this issue, allowing \\(n\\) to remain positive. While it is not ideal, it is more reasonable to say that out of all of the variables involved in Equation \\(\\eqref{eq:class_eq_20}\\), population growth and technological progress rates are the least likely to significantly change in the course of a year absent emergency conditions. I then take the value of the deposit interest rate for 2008, calibrate the rate of time preference as I did with the average prior to 2008 in Section¬†3.2.1, and plug all the values into Equation \\(\\eqref{eq:class_eq_20}\\). The resulting estimate is \\(\\theta=1.61\\), which is higher than the estimates noted later, but is not unreasonable to see high jumps in risk aversion under the context of the Global Financial Crisis as seen in Bekaert, Engstrom, and Xu (2022).\n\nAlthough I cannot exactly replicate the methodology of G√°ndelman and Hern√°ndez-Murillo (2015), I can use their essential model \\(\\eqref{eq:HappyPaper2}\\) and substitute it with national rather than individual data. For example, instead of using individual reports of household income, I use per capita Gross Domestic Product. Similarly, rather than using individual reports of happiness, I use the OECD (2017b) Consumer Confidence Index which reflects consumer sentiments nationally. Although data for this index is not available from the OECD for Bosnia, there are a number of countries similar to Bosnia with data available. I choose Greece, Hungary, Slovenia, and T√ºrkiye as they are countries near Bosnia that do not generally have hugely higher incomes (none except Slovenia have a GDP per capita greater than \\(\\approx\\)$20,000 current USD) and have OECD data available. While this is not a one-for-one replacement, these are sets of data that answer alike questions. For income and all other variables‚Äîexcept the Consumer Confidence Index‚Äîincluded in the model \\(\\eqref{eq:HappyPaper2}\\) I find national substitutes for Bosnia covering the period 1996 to 2008. Since not all variables are available monthly, I average the index yearly. Further, since some countries selected from the Consumer Confidence Index do not have data available for many periods prior to 2007 I average the index values for the four countries together yearly. I then regress the model over the period 1996 to 2007 to derive coefficients for each variable. Lastly, I plug in values for the year 2008 and solve for \\(\\theta\\) using the coefficients derived. The substitutes that I was able to find do not change all that much in 2008 relative to the prior years included, so the resulting estimate for \\(\\theta\\) in 2008 is almost equal to that of years prior. Ignoring the limited number of observation periods in this implementation, this method could be useful but the substitute values that I have found simply do not do well by it.\n\nThe last estimation method is to take the OECD (2017a) Consumer Barometer, which is the normalized change in the Consumer Confidence Index, and multiply the averaged yearly value for 2008 by the initial estimate (\\(\\theta =0.72\\)). The reasoning for this is that if a measure of happiness can be related to risk aversion‚Äîas it is inversely by G√°ndelman and Hern√°ndez-Murillo (2015)‚Äîand if the Consumer Confidence Index can be considered a substitute for such a measure, then the change in that index could be considered akin to a change in the prior measure, which would then mean a change in risk aversion. Since this is simply a change value that I am multiplying as a scalar rather than regressing, I am unconcerned by some countries not having data until the 2000s and select a range of values. I select from the four countries (Greece, Hungary, Slovenia, and T√ºrkiye) for the ones with the least (Hungary, \\(\\Delta \\approx -0.06\\)) and most (T√ºrkiye, \\(\\Delta \\approx -0.23\\)) negative average change in the Consumer Barometer for the year 2008. I also take the average (\\(\\Delta \\approx -0.13\\)) across all four countries. This results in three estimates: \\(\\theta=0.77, 0.81, 0.89\\). This is a good range of estimates, although the lowest one is only very marginally different from the initial value. It is worth noting that the low estimate for \\(\\theta\\) comes from the Consumer Barometer for Hungary, which is not considered a middle-income country, whereas the high estimate comes from T√ºrkiye which is considered one. In fact, T√ºrkiye is the only country of the four to be considered middle-income, so perhaps the higher estimate is a better characterization for Bosnia. To support this, looking at another middle-income country‚Äîalbeit one not close to Bosnia‚ÄîBrazil has an average yearly change that is more negative than the average of the four countries (\\(\\Delta \\approx -0.17\\)). With this in mind, and Bekaert, Engstrom, and Xu (2022), I think it best to focus on the highest estimate, \\(\\theta=0.89\\) of the three.\n\nWhile the second method would have been ideal, it was not feasible for the reasons outlined earlier. By contrast, the first and third methods each have some positives and negatives. For the former, it provides an estimate that feels sufficiently high given the circumstances while not requiring any particularly severe leaps of logic. However, the first method still requires me to hold constant some data that is not constant‚Äîeven if it is slow-changing‚Äîand to make personal assumptions about data integrity under wartime conditions. For the latter, it requires only the assumption that consumer confidence and happiness are closely related. However, the third method provides much lower estimates than the first‚Äînot even the largest one is two-tenths greater than the pre-crisis estimate‚Äîand frankly, the numbers appear too low for a financial crisis based on analyses of changes in risk-aversion during the financial crisis (Bekaert, Engstrom, and Xu 2022). In all, I carry forward the former and latter as the high and low ends of a range of possible estimates. I also take the mean of the two \\(\\theta=1 .25\\) to serve as a middle-road estimate.\n\nRelative Risk Aversion (\\(\\theta\\)) Estimates for 2008\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(~~~~\\text{Low}~~~\\)\n\\(~~\\text{Middle}~~~\\)\n\\(~~~~\\text{High}~~~\\)\n\n\n\n\n\\(~~~~\\theta~~~\\)\n\\(~~~~0.89~~~\\)\n\\(~~~~1.25~~~\\)\n\\(~~~~1.61~~~\\)"

By contrast, consumption and investment both begin outside the steady state level at the initial period of change, with consumption beginning above and decreasing thereafter, and investment beginning below and increasing to just below that level by the end. Just as before, based on Equation \\(\\eqref{eq:class_eq_15}\\) and Equation \\(\\eqref{eq:class_eq_16}\\), and the discussion in Section¬†2.2, it is clear why consumption decreases over time with the change in risk aversion‚Äîand since the variables of interest are all related, that explains the changes in the other variables. Consumption decreases because \\(\\theta\\) has increased and \\(\\theta\\) reduces consumption in the steady state equations. Recall that \\(1 \\over \\theta\\) represents the elasticity of intertemporal substitution and that if it is low‚Äîand with an increase in risk aversion, elasticity would become lower‚Äîindividuals are more willing to save rather than consume in a single period. Output decreases because it is a function of capital accumulation from the intertemporal budget constraint, and since the capital accumulation decreases to maintain equilibrium when consumption decreases, so does the output. Investment begins below equilibrium and rises to a point still below the initial steady state because it must reflect the national accounts identities as seen in Equation \\(\\eqref{eq:class_eq_21}\\). Since government expenditure is an exogenous constant and this model simulates a closed economy, the only two things that constitute output and can change in terms of national accounts are consumption and investment. Output begins at the equilibrium steady state level and decreases in dynamic simulations, but consumption begins above the steady state and decreases. This means that investment must begin below and rise (although still to a point below equilibrium) for the national accounts identities to hold. These dynamics are consistent with the theory outlined in Section¬†2.1, and evidence that the model is robust even if it imperfectly estimates the levels.\n\nIn the long run, the variables of interest are all below the initial equilibrium level. However, in the earlier periods, consumption is still above the initial steady state, and investment is far below. Looking at Table¬†6, one can see the changes in the growth rates of the variables over time. By year 10, output and investment are down by \\(0.16\\%\\) and \\(17.58\\%\\) respectively, and consumption is up by \\(0.28\\%\\) when \\(\\theta=0.89\\). However by year 20, output is down by \\(0.27\\%\\) but investment is down by only \\(12.28\\%\\)‚Äîindicating that investment is actually increasing back towards the original equilibrium, as seen in Figure¬†2 (c)‚Äîand consumption is up by only \\(0.03\\%\\) when \\(\\theta=0.89\\)‚Äîindicating that consumption is decreasing as seen in Figure¬†2 (b). This same story plays out across all values of \\(\\theta\\). In year 10 when \\(\\theta=1.25\\), output and investment are down by \\(0.43\\%\\) and \\(47.05\\%\\) respectively, and consumption is up by \\(0.77\\%\\), whereas by year 20 output and investment are down by \\(0.73\\%\\) and \\(35.15\\%\\) respectively, and consumption is up by \\(0.15\\%\\). In year 10 when \\(\\theta=1.61\\), output and investment are down by \\(0.61\\%\\) and \\(69.51\\%\\) respectively, and consumption is up by \\(1.15\\%\\), whereas by year 20 output and investment are down by \\(1.08\\%\\) and \\(54.16\\%\\) respectively, and consumption is up by \\(0.28\\%\\). As can be seen, the larger the increase in \\(\\theta\\), the sharper the initial spike and downturn in consumption and investment respectively. Additionally, looking at Table¬†5, the growth rates of output and consumption are always lowest and investment always highest in year 20 when compared to year 5 respectively, which makes sense given what was observed in Table¬†6. For example, in year 10 when \\(\\theta=1.61\\), output, consumption, and investment are \\(2.89\\), \\(2.27\\), and \\(0.02\\) respectively, whereas by year 20 output, consumption, and investment are \\(2.88\\), \\(2.25\\), and \\(0.03\\) respectively."

To determine a new value for the rate of time preference (\\(\\rho\\)), I first search for a new value for the interest rate \\(r\\) and then solve for the value of \\(\\rho\\) as in Section¬†3.2.1. To find this value, I must change my source of data from the deposit interest rate to something else and take its average. Many typical sources for this rate‚Äîbond yields and corporate rates‚Äîwere not available for the 2007 and prior time periods. I elect to use data on the net interest margin of banks in Bosnia from the World Bank (code: GFDD.EI.01). This records the net interest revenue of banks as a share of their interest-bearing assets, meaning that it illustrates the relative rate of interest banks see yearly. Plugging in the average of values for and before 2007 results in the new value for the rate of time preference, \\(\\rho=0.05243\\). The resulting steady state with the updated value of \\(\\rho\\) shows little change to the estimations of macroeconomic ratios when compared to Table¬†2.\n\n\n\n5.1.2 Results\nThe variables of interest, \\(y\\), \\(c\\), \\(i\\), all have lower steady-state values with the adjustment to the value of \\(\\rho\\) still decreasing following the changes in \\(\\theta\\) as in the model without the adjusted value of \\(\\rho\\):\n\n\n\n\nTable¬†7: Steady States (With Higher Rate of Time Preference \\(\\rho\\))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) \\(\\rho=0.03776\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(~~~~~y~~\\)\n\\(~~~~~c~~\\)\n\\(~~~~~i~~\\)\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\theta=0.72\\)\n\\(~~~2.91\\)\n\\(~~~2.24\\)\n\\(~~~0.06\\)\n\n\n\\(\\theta=0.89\\)\n\\(~~~2.89\\)\n\\(~~2.23\\)\n\\(~~~0.06\\)\n\n\n\\(~~~\\Delta\\) (%)\n\\(-0.50\\)\n\\(-0.47\\)\n\\(-1.49\\)\n\n\n\\(\\theta=1.25\\)\n\\(~~~2.86\\)\n\\(~~~2.21\\)\n\\(~~~0.05\\)\n\n\n\\(~~~\\Delta\\) (%)\n\\(-1.53\\)\n\\(-1.45\\)\n\\(-4.52\\)\n\n\n\\(\\theta=1.61\\)\n\\(~~~2.83\\)\n\\(~~~2.19\\)\n\\(~~~0.05\\)\n\n\n\\(~~~\\Delta\\) (%)\n\\(-2.53\\)\n\\(-2.41\\)\n\\(-7.40\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) \\(\\rho=0.05243\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(~~~~~y~~\\)\n\\(~~~~~c~~\\)\n\\(~~~~~i~~\\)\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\theta=0.72\\)\n\\(~~~2.48\\)\n\\(~~~1.93\\)\n\\(~~~0.04\\)\n\n\n\\(\\theta=0.89\\)\n\\(~~~2.57\\)\n\\(~~~1.92\\)\n\\(~~~0.04\\)\n\n\n\\(~~~\\Delta\\) (%)\n\\(-0.36\\)\n\\(-0.35\\)\n\\(-1.09\\)\n\n\n\\(\\theta=1.25\\)\n\\(~~~2.45\\)\n\\(~~~1.90\\)\n\\(~~~0.03\\)\n\n\n\\(~~~\\Delta\\) (%)\n\\(-1.12\\)\n\\(-1.08\\)\n\\(-3.33\\)\n\n\n\\(\\theta=1.61\\)\n\\(~~~2.44\\)\n\\(~~~1.89\\)\n\\(~~~0.03\\)\n\n\n\\(~~~\\Delta\\) (%)\n\\(-1.86\\)\n\\(-1.80\\)\n\\(-5.49\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs seen in Table¬†7, just as in Table¬†4, no matter the higher value of \\(\\theta\\), all variables of interest decrease between steady states.

When \\(\\theta=1.61\\), output, consumption, and investment decrease by \\(1.86\\%\\), \\(1.80\\%\\), and \\(5.49\\%\\) respectively. However, both the steady-state levels per each value of \\(\\theta\\), and the changes between them are slightly different. Output is decreased in Table¬†7 (b) (new value of \\(\\rho\\)) when compared to Table¬†7 (a) (initial \\(\\rho\\)), alongside consumption and investment, but the ratios of the latter two to the former remain about the same as seen when comparing their initial steady states.\n\nUsing the new value for the rate of time preference, I simulate the quantitative impacts on the Bosnian economy of the increase in risk aversion from the 2008 crisis. I only simulate the change from \\(\\theta=0.72\\) to \\(\\theta=1.61\\) since the difference in this case is the new value of \\(\\rho\\). Below are time paths comparing the change in the coefficient of relative risk aversion depending on the value of the rate of time preference (\\(y\\), \\(c\\), \\(i\\) when \\(\\theta\\) increases from \\(0.72\\) to \\(1.61\\) for when \\(\\rho\\) is \\(0.03776\\) and \\(0.05243\\), \\(t=\\) years):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Evolution of Output (\\(\\rho=0.05243\\))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Evolution of Consumption (\\(\\rho=0.05243\\))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) Evolution of Investment (\\(\\rho=0.05243\\))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†3: Evolution of Variables of Interest over Time after 2008 Crisis (With Higher Rate of Time Preference \\(\\rho\\))\n\n\n\n\nThe dashed and dotted lines in the above figures show the steady state prior to the change in \\(\\theta\\) when \\(\\rho=0.03776\\) and \\(\\rho=0.05243\\) respectively. The time paths of output and consumption are very similar to those seen in Figure¬†2 (a) and Figure¬†2, although that of consumption does become negative by year 20. This slight difference in the time path for consumption leads the time path for investment to increase further as time passes. This dynamic of consumption dropping more steeply with time makes sense intuitively: a higher rate of time preference‚Äîthe premium for impatience‚Äîwill result in greater emphasis being placed on consumption in earlier years, with later years increasingly written off. These dynamics show that the model is fairly robust."

    "text": "5.2 A New Value of Taxation (\\(T \\over Y\\))\nGiven the exogenous nature of the tax ratio, it is worth investigating the effects of changing it in the model. As in Section¬†3.2.1 when discussing the underestimation of investment in the steady state, government spending takes out a share of GDP in the national accounts identities of Bosnia, but a decrease in it would exclusively go towards a higher steady-state level of consumption. It is worth investigating if there are any other dynamic differences from a change in taxation. By all accounts, there should not be. For this adjustment in the tax ratio, I do not set it to zero, but instead to a slightly higher level. I take the average of government expenditure for the years 2005 to 2007 from the World Bank (2024b) and set the tax ratio to \\({T \\over Y}=0.34228\\). This new value means that over \\(34\\%\\) of output will go towards taxation.\n\n\n5.2.1 Data and Model\nAdjusting the model to simulate the economy with a new value for the tax ratio does not require any changes to it, only to the value of \\(T \\over Y\\).\n\n\n\n5.2.2 Results\nOnly \\(c\\) has a different‚Äîhigher‚Äî steady-state value when compared to Table¬†4.\n\n\n\n\nTable¬†8: Steady States (With Higher Tax Ratio \\(T \\over Y\\))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) \\({T \\over Y}=0.20990\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(~~~~~y~~\\)\n\\(~~~~~c~~\\)\n\\(~~~~~i~~\\)\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\theta=0.72\\)\n\\(~~~2.91\\)\n\\(~~~2.24\\)\n\\(~~~0.06\\)\n\n\n\\(\\theta=0.89\\)\n\\(~~~2.89\\)\n\\(~~~2.23\\)\n\\(~~~0.06\\)\n\n\n\\(~~~\\Delta\\) (%)\n\\(-0.50\\)\n\\(-0.47\\)\n\\(-1.49\\)\n\n\n\\(\\theta=1.25\\)\n\\(~~~2.86\\)\n\\(~~~2.21\\)\n\\(~~~0.05\\)\n\n\n\\(~~~\\Delta\\) (%)\n\\(-1.53\\)\n\\(-1.45\\)\n\\(-4.52\\)\n\n\n\\(\\theta=1.61\\)\n\\(~~~2.83\\)\n\\(~~~2.19\\)\n\\(~~~0.05\\)\n\n\n\\(~~~\\Delta\\) (%)\n\\(-2.53\\)\n\\(-2.41\\)\n\\(-7.40\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) \\({T \\over Y}=0.34228\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(~~~~~y~~\\)\n\\(~~~~~c~~\\)\n\\(~~~~~i~~\\)\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\theta=0.72\\)\n\\(~~~2.91\\)\n\\(~~~1,85\\)\n\\(~~~0.06\\)\n\n\n\\(\\theta=0.89\\)\n\\(~~~2.89\\)\n\\(~~~1.85\\)\n\\(~~~0.06\\)\n\n\n\\(~~~\\Delta\\) (%)\n\\(-0.50\\)\n\\(-0.47\\)\n\\(-1.49\\)\n\n\n\\(\\theta=1.25\\)\n\\(~~~2.86\\)\n\\(~~~1.83\\)\n\\(~~0.05\\)\n\n\n\\(~~~\\Delta\\) (%)\n\\(-1.53\\)\n\\(-1.44\\)\n\\(-4.52\\)\n\n\n\\(\\theta=1.61\\)\n\\(~~~2.83\\)\n\\(~~~1.81\\)\n\\(~~~0.05\\)\n\n\n\\(~~~\\Delta\\) (%)\n\\(-2.53\\)\n\\(-2.38\\)\n\\(-7.40\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe resulting steady state with the updated value of \\(T \\over Y\\) shows no change to investment as a share of GDP, with taxes assuming a portion of the share held prior by consumption. The model now underestimates consumption and still greatly underestimates investment in the steady state. As seen in Table¬†8, just as in Table¬†4, no matter the value of \\(\\theta\\), all variables of interest decrease between steady states. When \\(\\theta=0.89\\), output, consumption, and investment decrease by \\(0.50\\%\\), \\(0.47\\%\\), \\(1.49\\%\\) respectively. When \\(\\theta=1.25\\), output, consumption, and investment decrease by \\(1.53\\%\\), \\(1.44\\%\\), and \\(4.52\\%\\) respectively. When \\(\\theta=1.61\\), output, consumption, and investment decrease by \\(2.53\\%\\), \\(2.38\\%\\), and \\(7.40\\%\\) respectively. However, only the steady state levels and changes of consumption are different per each value of \\(\\theta\\) when Table¬†8 (b) and Table¬†8 (a) are compared‚Äîthe levels are the same for output and investment as in Table¬†4 as well as the changes between steady states. The change to the tax ratio has almost no effect beyond snatching some of the share of output once held by consumption. Unlike the change to \\(\\rho\\) from the prior section, output is not reduced at all by this change to \\(T \\over Y\\), and instead, it is the ratio of consumption to output that is changed, rather than the level of output. This is consistent with Section¬†3.2.1, where it was demonstrated in Table¬†3 that changes in taxation only affect consumption in the RCK model.\n\nUsing the new value for the tax ratio, I simulate the quantitative impacts on the Bosnian economy of the increase in risk aversion from the 2008 crisis. Below are time paths comparing the change in the coefficient of relative risk aversion depending on the value of the tax ratio (\\(y\\), \\(c\\), \\(i\\) when \\(\\theta\\) increases from \\(0.72\\) to \\(1.61\\) for when \\(T \\over Y\\) is \\(0.20990\\) and \\(0.34228\\), \\(t=\\) years):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Evolution of Output (\\({T \\over Y}=0.34228\\))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Evolution of Consumption (\\({T \\over Y}=0.34228\\))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) Evolution of Investment (\\({T \\over Y}=0.34228\\))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†4: Evolution of Variables of Interest over Time after 2008 Crisis (With Higher Tax Ratio \\({T \\over Y}\\))\n\n\n\n\nThe dashed and dotted lines in the above figures show the steady state prior to the change in \\(\\theta\\) when \\({T \\over Y}=0.20990\\) and \\({T \\over Y}=0\\) respectively. As can be seen, the resulting changes lie entirely with consumption, with it being significantly higher in level at all points in the time path. Do these results imply anything about tax cuts as a policy to stimulate investment? Not really. Again, this is more a reflection of the shortcomings of a closed economy model imposed on an economy with a high trade deficit. However, it is not unreasonable to say that cutting taxes to spur investment would similarly not function as a one-to-one interaction, with much of the difference rather being saved or consumed. Either way, the dynamics of the model are identical following the change in the tax ratio, with consumption only being higher in absolute level. This is consistent with what was discussed in Section¬†3.2.1, and is further evidence of robustness in terms of dynamic results from the model."

    "text": "5.3 Introducing Depreciation (\\(\\delta\\))\nGiven that assets in the real world tend to depreciate, it is worth investigating how introducing a rate of depreciation may impact the model. In the real world, capital depreciation leads to investment in capital stock. Existing machinery, for example, cannot be relied on forever, and must be updated eventually. However, even if introducing depreciation increases the share of investment in output, that share would come from what was held by consumption‚Äîtaxes are static and exogenous and there are still no trade flows‚Äîthus reducing its share of output. However, knowing that these dynamics would be the likely result of the introduction of depreciation to the model, it is worth seeing by how much the shares of each of these things are changed in the steady states and dynamic simulations.\n\n\n5.3.1 Data and Model\nIntroducing a non-zero value for depreciation, \\(\\delta\\), adjusts the formulation of the model. The optimality conditions for firms are changed such that Equation \\(\\eqref{eq:class_eq_2}\\) is rewritten as:\n\\[\nr = f'(k)-\\delta \\label{eq:class_eq_26} \\tag{26}\n\\]\nwhich results in new equations of the loci:\n\\[\n\\frac{\\dot{c}}{c}=\\frac{1}{\\theta}(f'(k)-\\rho)-(\\delta+n+g) \\label{eq:class_eq_27} \\tag{27}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\dot{k}=f(k)-k(\\delta+n+g)-c-T \\label{eq:class_eq_28} \\tag{28}\n\\]\nand new steady-state equations:\n\\[\nk=({\\frac{\\theta(\\delta+n+g)+\\rho}{\\alpha}})^\\frac{1}{\\alpha-1} \\label{eq:class_eq_29} \\tag{29}\n\\]\n\\[\nc=k^{\\alpha}-k(\\delta+n+g)-T \\label{eq:class_eq_30} \\tag{30}\n\\]\nData on the depreciation rate is sourced from the Penn World Table as an average for the 1996 to 2007 period for Bosnia. The resulting steady state with \\(\\delta\\) shows a large change to consumption and investment as shares of GDP. The model now underestimates the share of consumption with the difference being added to the share of investment. This makes sense and follows the theoretical explanation outlined earlier‚Äîcapital depreciation spurs investment in capital stock, resulting in a larger share of output being diverted to investment.\n\n\n\n5.3.2 Results\nThe steady-state outcomes across values of \\(\\theta\\) show a clear departure from those found in Table¬†4. While \\(y\\) and \\(c\\) are lower across steady states, \\(i\\) is higher with the non-zero value of \\(\\delta\\).\n\n\n\n\nTable¬†9: Steady States (With Depreciation \\(\\delta\\))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) \\(\\delta=0\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(~~~~~y~~\\)\n\\(~~~~~c~~\\)\n\\(~~~~~i~~\\)\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\theta=0.72\\)\n\\(~~~2.91\\)\n\\(~~~2.24\\)\n\\(~~~0.06\\)\n\n\n\\(\\theta=0.89\\)\n\\(~~~2.89\\)\n\\(~~~2.23\\)\n\\(~~~0.06\\)\n\n\n\\(~~~\\Delta\\) (%)\n\\(-0.50\\)\n\\(-0.47\\)\n\\(-1.49\\)\n\n\n\\(\\theta=1.25\\)\n\\(~~~2.86\\)\n\\(~~~2.21\\)\n\\(~~~0.05\\)\n\n\n\\(~~~\\Delta\\) (%)\n\\(-1.53\\)\n\\(-1.45\\)\n\\(-4.52\\)\n\n\n\\(\\theta=1.61\\)\n\\(~~~2.83\\)\n\\(~~~2.19\\)\n\\(~~~0.05\\)\n\n\n\\(~~~\\Delta\\) (%)\n\\(-2.53\\)\n\\(-2.41\\)\n\\(-7.40\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) \\(\\delta=0.06403\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(~~~~~y~~\\)\n\\(~~~~~c~~\\)\n\\(~~~~~i~~\\)\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\theta=0.72\\)\n\\(~~~1.97\\)\n\\(~~~1.05\\)\n\\(~~~0.51\\)\n\n\n\\(\\theta=0.89\\)\n\\(~~~1.86\\)\n\\(~~~1.04\\)\n\\(~~~0.42\\)\n\n\n\\(~~~\\Delta\\) (%)\n\\(-6.01\\)\n\\(-0.68\\)\n\\(-16.96\\)\n\n\n\\(\\theta=1.25\\)\n\\(~~~1.66\\)\n\\(~~~1.01\\)\n\\(~~~0.30\\)\n\n\n\\(~~~\\Delta\\) (%)\n\\(-15.82\\)\n\\(-3.87\\)\n\\(-40.35\\)\n\n\n\\(\\theta=1.61\\)\n\\(~~~1.52\\)\n\\(~~~0.97\\)\n\\(~~~0.23\\)\n\n\n\\(~~~\\Delta\\) (%)\n\\(-23.09\\)\n\\(-7.80\\)\n\\(-54.50\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs seen in Table¬†9, just as in Table¬†4, no matter the value of \\(\\theta\\), all variables of interest decrease between steady states. When \\(\\theta=0.89\\), output, consumption, and investment decrease by \\(6.01\\%\\), \\(0.68\\%\\), and \\(16.96\\%\\) respectively. When \\(\\theta=1.25\\), output, consumption, and investment decrease by \\(15.82\\%\\), \\(3.87\\%\\), and \\(40.35\\%\\) respectively. When \\(\\theta=1.61\\), output, consumption, and investment decrease by $23.09%$, $7.80%$, and \\(54.50\\%\\) respectively. However, both the steady-state levels per each value of \\(\\theta\\), and the changes between them are all very different. Introducing depreciation, \\(\\delta\\), greatly reduces the steady-state levels of output and consumption across all values of \\(\\theta\\) and greatly magnifies the size of their changes between steady-state levels. Additionally, the results of investment are very significantly affected by depreciation. The dynamic response of investment is increased ten-fold and decreases sharply between \\(\\theta\\) values. The introduction of depreciation has both reduced output and changed the respective shares of consumption and investment in it. A change in the level makes sense intuitively. First, if assets depreciate output is lost by their depreciation. Second, if assets depreciate, it is necessary to invest in them to prevent further losses to output. Together these two realities explain the level but not the dynamic response.\n\nUsing the new value for depreciation, I simulate the quantitative impacts on the Bosnian economy of the increase in risk aversion from the 2008 crisis. Below are time paths comparing the change in the coefficient of relative risk aversion depending on the value of depreciation (\\(y\\), \\(c\\), \\(i\\) when \\(\\theta\\) increases from \\(0.72\\) to \\(1.61\\) for when \\(\\delta\\) is \\(0\\) and \\(0.06403~\\), \\(t=\\) years):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Evolution of Output (\\(\\delta=0.06403\\))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Evolution of Consumption (\\(\\delta=0.06403\\))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) Evolution of Investment (\\(\\delta=0.06403\\))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†5: Evolution of Variables of Interest over Time after 2008 Crisis (With Depreciation \\(\\delta\\))\n\n\n\n\nThe dashed and dotted lines in the above figures show the steady state prior to the change in \\(\\theta\\) when \\(\\delta=0\\) and \\(\\delta=0.06403\\) respectively. As can be seen, the resulting changes starkly contrast the initial time paths seen in Figure¬†2. For example, output and consumption begin above their steady states as still expected but decrease so sharply that the first few periods are cut off from the graphs. Investment, by contrast, sees the opposite and is significantly higher across time when compared to Figure¬†2 (c). The dynamics here are very different from those of the model without depreciation, and evidence that my results with the baseline calibration are not robust to new values of \\(\\delta\\) as far as the dynamic response to investment is concerned."

    "text": "1 Introduction\nRecently I was reminded of the existence of the show The Walking Dead, and something just didn‚Äôt sit right in my mind‚Äîhow in God‚Äôs name was it still on air by 2022? I can‚Äôt say if the show was still any good by that point (I stopped watching around season 5 in my youth) but I know, however anecdotal this is, that I did not hear a lick of news about it for the last 5 years. Actually its been more than 5 years, I haven‚Äôt heard anything in the general conscious since the death of Glenn and even that was only a blip in a growing stream of silence. I don‚Äôt want to bash on a show that has‚Äîmercifully‚Äîbeen over for 2 years now. Rather, my realization that The Walking Dead had crawled along for so long, and somehow with decent reviews online, has presented me with a fun question to explore:\n\nAre obvious metrics even reliable? Can we actually trust something like user reviews simply because they are collected in aggregate?\n\nTo explain the train of thought that arrived at the question in the above block quote, I‚Äôve provided the following extremely vital (and improperly formatted) flowchart(s):\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFlowchart\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart TD\n    A(Wow!

What is a world without The Simpsons?)\n    AAA --&gt;AAB(Wow that's heavy, you should be a poet.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe immediate answer to the question posed is that user-reviews may be biased by selection bias. Sometimes, perhaps, we can trust user-review aggregates, but other times selection bias is too strong. This is because user-reviews are entirely voluntary at not one but two stages. First (excluding review-bombing), users presumably must choose to watch a show and form an opinion. Second, users must decide that their opinion is worth expressing online in a review. If, for example, a show is slowly dying and only the truest of true fans are left watching, the user-reviews will be biased in aggregate, because those who may otherwise negatively review the show have already dropped out at stage one. This phenomenon isn‚Äôt particularly difficult to grasp, but, I think The Walking Dead television show provides a very good example. For the next few sections, I‚Äôll demonstrate how even obvious data can be difficult to trust by using a long-zombified, now-dead, television show as an example. Specifically, I will be looking at viewership statistics and IMDB ratings for The Walking Dead over time.\n\n\n2 The Walking Dead\nTo call The Walking Dead a ‚ÄúZombie Show‚Äù in its final season would not only be reflective of its content by then, but too of its character. Despite facing declining average viewership as early as season 5, it trudged on for 6 more seasons. Before talking about reviews, I want to make sure that we are in agreement about the death of the show. Below is a graph displaying the television viewership counts in the United States of The Walking Dead per episode and split across seasons (‚ÄúSunday Cable Ratings [Multiple]‚Äù 2010-2018; ‚ÄúShowbuzz Daily Sunday Top 150 Cable Originals Network Finals [Multiple]‚Äù 2019-2022):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†1: Zombie Show: TV Viewership of The Walking Dead by Episode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload Plot Download Animated Plot\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy the above chart in Figure¬†1, viewership counts have faced a sustained decline since around the middle of season 5, with a notable spike in the first episode of season 7‚Äîthe death of Glenn. Looking at the data, there is a fair criticism right off the bat: these are cable television viewership stats, and people have been cord-cutting (Rainie 2021) for years. What if, the show was not experiencing as dramatic a fall-off as I am depicting? Unfortunately, no, cord-cutting does not explain away the woes of the show. In fact, according to FCC (2019-2022), more people had cable subscriptions in 2018 than any year prior in the period from 2010 to 2022, and we know The Walking Dead was losing viewers long before then.\n\nPerhaps many with cable subscriptions just didn‚Äôt watch much cable anyways by then. As Molla (2018) points out, ‚ÄúCable and satellite companies often include TV, internet and telephone for a single reduced price. For many [American cable subscribers], the cost they‚Äôd have to pay for internet alone isn‚Äôt much less than they would pay for all three services individually, so the perceived value can seem tempting. In turn, the cable companies are able to eke out higher overall monthly fees by throwing in those ‚Äòextras.‚Äô‚Äù There could be many cable subscribers then and now who don‚Äôt actually take much advantage of their cable subscription. However, just because subscribers choose not to watch cable doesn‚Äôt mean they can‚Äôt. I am sure that if someone had easy access to something, the only reason they wouldn‚Äôt use it is because they don‚Äôt want to‚Äîif someone already has cable, the reason they wouldn‚Äôt be watching The Walking Dead is either because they don‚Äôt want to or they don‚Äôt have time to, and in the latter case, that seems not to have stopped viewership prior. Given what we know, the graph below is functionally the same as Figure¬†1 so I‚Äôve put it in a collapsed note to avoid taking up too much space with graphs that convey similar points. If you‚Äôd like to view this second graph anyways, just click on the note to expand it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Same Graph as Figure¬†1 But Now Adjusted for Cable Subscription Figures\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†2: Zombie Show: TV Viewership of The Walking Dead by Episode (Adjusted for Cable Subscriber Counts)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload Plot Download Animated Plot\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClearly the viewership decline was genuine, so what made people stop watching? If people could watch but did not want to‚Äîpresumably‚Äîthe show got worse, or at least worse than competitive offerings in similar categories at the time.\n\n\n3 The Problem with User Ratings\nCritics have been around forever, but only with the advent of review aggregators can we combine reviews from around the world and seemingly come to a general critic consensus on a show. However another‚Äîarguably more impactful‚Äîthing that aggregators did was ‚Äúdemocratize‚Äù reviews. Now anyone from around the world can praise or hate on their media of the day. For the purpose of my guiding question from Section¬†1, I am focusing on user-reviews, which are both more plentiful and often more diverse at the level of individual ratings. If we can trust these reviews, surely they should tell us that The Walking Dead got worse (and that would explain why people stopped watching when they otherwise could watch). Below are two charts displaying Internet Movie Database (IMDB) viewer ratings of the show over time:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Line Plot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Violin Plot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†3: Zombie Show: IMDB Viewer Ratings of The Walking Dead Episodes by Season\n\n\n\nDownload Plot Download Animated Plot\nDownload Violin Plot Download Animated Violin Plot\n\n\n\n\nAs seen in Figure¬†3, for the most part (excluding some real stinkers in season 10 apparently), reviews of the show remained positive throughout a dramatic and sustained loss in viewership. People tuned out‚Äîpresumably because they didn‚Äôt like the show enough to watch anymore‚Äîbut the reviews didn‚Äôt exactly nosedive. If we know people could watch the show, and we see the reviews weren‚Äôt totally tanking, why we fewer people watching? There are a few main possibilities:\n\nEven if the show wasn‚Äôt bad perhaps there were better shows. But this ignores the fact that people were already invested in one show. To completely stop watching a show you are already five seasons deep in just because another catches your eye just doesn‚Äôt sound likely.\nThe reviews are not reflective of the tastes of the general viewership. This is the one I want you to believe rather than the straw-man alternative I created.\n\nYou see, I don‚Äôt believe these ratings, and I have a simple explanation for why‚Äîdespite how they have great sample sizes and average everything out‚ÄîI don‚Äôt. I don‚Äôt believe these ratings because of the problem of selection bias from Section¬†1. People that watch shows are the ones that review them. If people become bored enough with a show to simply leave it, they stop reviewing it as well. This makes taking user reviews and aggregators seriously much more difficult.\n\nInterestingly, you can see very slightly that the the decrease in average reviews per episode and across seasons, is sharpest sometime around season 6 and 7, when there were still many people watching, but the slow trickle away of viewers had already begun. These reviews, given the scale of viewership then, likely included many from the general audience, rather than just die-hard fans, and are notably increasingly negative until there are fewer viewers. This observation aligns with the idea of reviews being biased near the end of the show by devoted viewers and as such I do not trust those reviews. Without watching these later seasons, and with a decade between myself and the last time I watched any of that show, I look to the dynamics of viewership to tell me if the show is worth watching and I don‚Äôt see good things.\n\n\n4 Conclusion\nI don‚Äôt want to entirely discredit user reviews‚Äîthat would be foolish. Instead, I propose a simple rule for anyone looking at reviews for a show or any similar episodic medium: give weight to the early reviews because that‚Äôs when the most general of audiences that has ever watched the show will watch and review the show. If you want to know what awaits you as a viewer down the line, check viewership numbers rather than reviews‚Äîif you see a steady decline, you can probably assume the show gets drab for the average viewer by then. I know I have been a little cruel against The Walking Dead, but there is simply no way in hell reviews were only down a point near the end for a show that had fallen to a tenth of its peak viewership, and this demonstrates the value of taking reviews‚Äîno matter how big your sample size is‚Äîwith a grain of salt.\n\n\n5 References\n\n\nFCC. 2019-2022. ‚ÄúFCC Annual Video Competition Report.‚Äù Federal Communications Commission. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cable_television_in_the_United_States#Statistics.\n\n\nMolla, Rani. 2018. ‚ÄúAmericans Are Still Paying for Cable Because It‚Äôs Bundled with Their Internet.‚Äù Vox. https://www.vox.com/2018/3/20/17139756/reasons-americans-us-pay-cord-cable-tv.\n\n\nRainie, Lee. 2021. ‚ÄúCable and Satellite TV Use Has Dropped Dramatically in the U.S. Since 2015.‚Äù Pew Research Center. https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2021/03/17/cable-and-satellite-tv-use-has-dropped-dramatically-in-the-u-s-since-2015/.\n\n\n‚ÄúShowbuzz Daily Sunday Top 150 Cable Originals Network Finals [Multiple].‚Äù 2019-2022.

    "section": "",
    "text": "1 A Bit About Small Towns\nThere is a saying, oft-repeated in the description of plaguing ills, which tells very well the tragedy of places that are neither wholly rural, nor truly city and are certainly not suburbia. First slowly, then suddenly. The small town‚Äîthe rural city‚Äîis a pocket‚Äîa vestige of what could have been looking out from some time immemorial when suburbia had not yet come to dominate. While the image of rural America‚Äîbutchered by popular depictions‚Äîmay tell of places hardly able to provide much of anything to their citizenry, the rural city is different. The rural city can provide, for now. But what after? There is little to do. A space of some thousands in number, educated relatively well, surrounded by dead industry and minimum wage service jobs. Sure, there are most opportunities available than in the truly empty spaces, but why stay for something so‚ÄîI feel very sorry to put it like this‚Äîmiddling? The tragedy of these places is that they manage to provide more than they are worth‚Äîcomparatively speaking‚Äîand present little reason to do anything but leave. ‚Äú[‚Ä¶] Small towns are especially good at recognizing, nurturing, and launching talented individuals. They rally to prepare achievers to leave, succeed brilliantly in doing so, then lament the loss of their combined talents‚Äù (Carr & Kefalas, p. 51). I do not want to dwell too long on this note, but keep it in mind as I talk about some interesting aspects of American rural education.\n\n\n2 Educational Attainment\nThe trope of the uneducated or undereducated rural is a gross exaggeration, and it washes over the variety of conditions which exist concerning education in rural America. When looking at primary and secondary education levels, the discrepancy is not exactly enormous. Particularly in the case of the former, ‚Äú[rural children] perform as well as urban children on standardized tests‚Äù (Clark, et al.). While standardized testing is a whole assortment of problems on its own, the fact the performance is generally consistent between rural and urban communities lends credence to the idea that the education gap below the post-secondary collegiate level is overblown. Where a clear discrepancy does exist though, is when it comes to higher levels of educational attainment. In terms of collegiate educational attainment ‚Äú[rural students are behind] suburban and urban counterparts [‚Ä¶] largely because of their lower socioeconomic background‚Äù (Byun, et al.). What is curious though, is that rural areas across the country tend to underperform the trend more at higher levels of income (see the figure below). The more potentially well-off, the worse the performance relatively.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis can be explained as rural counties simply making up a greater proportion of lower median income counties, but even with that in mind, urban counties at lower income levels do not tend to perform nearly as often and far above the trendline as they do at higher levels of income. The disparity between rural and urban educational achievement grows with greater levels of income. In this case, rurality is a greater determinant of attainment than income, but that is because the positive impact of rising incomes on education is conditioned by the negative impact of rurality. What could that negative impact be?\n\n\n3 Rural Income Inequality\nIt is not just that rural America is poor, it is that ‚Äú[‚Ä¶] high levels of local income inequality have been a disproportionally rural issue over the past half-century‚Äù (Butler, et al.). There are actually many places in the United States that are both very rural and very affluent but living in them as a less-than-affluent individual is a quick ticket to a harsh life. Less dense regions have a lesser availability of public resources to aid individuals who need help and that means that as you start climbing the ladder of costs‚Äîgoing to college is slightly more expensive than the 3rd grade‚Äîthose unable to bridge the gap will not. This is not the only factor, of course, and that is visible in the fact that at the state-level, sometimes the rural-urban divide on educational attainment is not so significant. For example, according to data from the U.S. Census and the American Community Survey (ACS), the divide in the state of Texas is significantly less pronounced than that in the states of Alabama, Kansas, or West Virginia. Still, we see at the national level that there is a correlation between median income and educational attainment, and we see that rural counties underperform relative to urban ones as median income levels rise.\n\n\n4 A Tangent About Rural Out-migration\nRecall the small town. What, thinking between income and post-secondary collegiate education, primarily influences out-migration from rural areas? Looking again at county-level data from the U.S. Census and ACS, in the states of Vermont and West Virginia, the rural counties that did not experience population decline between 2010 and 2020 tended to be wealthier. In West Virginia for example, Pleasants County with one of the lowest number of residents, 25 years or older, recorded as holding a bachelor‚Äôs degree or higher at 11.9%, was one of only 6 counties‚Äî4 rural counties‚Äîthat did not experience decline from 2010 to 2020. The counties not experiencing out-migration were, in all, less relatively poor than they were relatively or strictly uneducated. Income is a greater determinant than educational attainment in cases of migration when the two are examined purely side-by-side. The counties that did not experience population decline tended to be wealthier, even when they were not always particularly well educated compared to the rest of the state. Do people leave because they are educated or because they can make more money? There is a difference.\n\n\n5 Returning to Income\nIf the goal is strictly to improve collegiate educational attainment on the whole among rural American counties, it is easier to just say ‚Äúgive people money,‚Äù in light of how complex accounting for rurality becomes. I wholeheartedly support that measure as a currently poor college student (as of 2023, fingers crossed I win the lottery), but unfortunately it does not play well politically. Incomes would have to be raised endogenously, but how? Remember the small towns, people leave the moment they think they have the tools to make it somewhere better. Moreover due to regional variation, it is clear that some places will not even see much change in outcome from higher levels of income. What is more actionable? What could prepare people for jobs that are available even in rural spaces (not counting remote work but that is valuable to consider) such that they will not just leave, and what could do so for less than what is charged by universities today?\n\n\n6 One Idea\nTrade work is many things, but to avoid going into excruciating detail, think welders, electricians, mechanics, and all jobs of that nature. Trade work can be learned at trade schools. Trade schools tend to not only be cheaper than a baccalaureate education, but can provide an education that is‚Äîdepending on the subject of study‚Äîapplicable in almost any place, serving as a reliable ticket to employment even in rural counties. Additionally, vocational education can serve as an outlet for students who tend to underperform individually in classroom environments (Rich). This is skilled work that pays well, or at least better than a lot of work available in rural areas. This is also work that requires an education and ‚Äú[requires] workers who can interpret blueprints, program computerized machinery and solve problems on the fly‚Äù (Rich). Despite this, the federal government has not pinned nearly as much value as should be onto these institutions as possible centers of rural education in the past few years (Rich), allowing trade schools to fall out of the immediate mind even among some who live in the areas which could most benefit.\nTrade schools are cheaper to attend and can provide an education that is more than applicable to the job market in rural counties. The point is not to prevent people from pursuing an academic career, it is to promote an alternative that could convince them to stay closer to home by giving them a way to actually make money there. Additionally, opening up vocational opportunities could get older residents in rural counties back to school, which would improve general education in counties. ‚ÄúIn the future, most young adults will need post-secondary education in order to find good-paying jobs. However, millions of so-called ‚Äòmiddle skill jobs‚Äô will require something less than a bachelor‚Äôs degree‚Äù (Harvard Graduate School of Education). Again, this is an alternative that makes sense in the context of wanting to raise incomes and keep populations within rural communities as it will achieve one by the other and vice versa. These institutions have their own problems, and I will at some point expand on them, but for now I will close by saying that I think they are valuable to improving both incomes in rural areas and reducing out-migration. Perhaps, as incomes rise, more will later go on to pursue a baccalaureate education and hopefully, there will be more opportunities to use that degree at home in future.\n\nReferences\n\n1.

    "text": "1 Something Isn‚Äôt Right\n There has been a lot in the news about ‚Äúrecession‚Äù recently and, considering current data, it does not make much sense.  While wages went up (USBLS) and comparatively decent jobs remain available, half the country seems to think that we are back in 2008. Hell, unemployment is back to pre-pandemic levels (USBLS), with long-term unemployment (27 weeks or more) falling as well, and the federal funds rate, while rising steeply, just hit what it was around this same time in 2019 (FRED). It is not like nothing is going on, though, something must be off for people to be so concerned, so what is it? Prices. That is it, or a lot of it. The confluence of ongoing supply chain issues, a war in one of the most vital exporting countries in the grain market (WSJ) instigated by an important export country in the natural gas market, greed, and yes, to an extent the rapid expansion of the money supply from government assistance during the pandemic has worked out to a sharp rise in prices across the board. Is this concerning? Absolutely. Is this a recession? No.¬†So why do I keep hearing the word?\n\n\n2 Ignoring the Data\nIn 2020 a global pandemic threw the global economy for a loop. Industries whose work could not easily be transferred online declined and millions of people were suddenly unemployed, and no one was sure when exactly things would end. Two years later and the pandemic is still close to us. Some of those millions who were unemployed, and many others, are dead now. But one could be forgiven for mistaking that things had passed with how little care many seem to have anymore. This general sense of apathy, or at least conscious ignorance, has grown so bad in fact that there is already some whole new pandemic and I have yet to hear a single real person share much concern over it. No one wants to care about anymore, and the governments of the world‚Äîwhich had at one time thrown enormous sums of money into the void which constituted their pandemic economies‚Äîhave just as quickly dropped all mandates and shoved everyone back to the workplace. On one hand this makes sense, there is a feeling that prior to the pandemic things made some kind of sense and that organizations should return to their state of being. On the other hand, over one million people have died, just in the United States, and many are still dying, and no matter how much we choose to ignore it, things are not just going to become normal.\nBut what does any of that have to do with our present recessionary woes? A great deal, actually.\nThe trouble with selectively detaching yourself from the realities before you is that it becomes hard to keep up with everything else. While national economies are no strangers to emotion‚Äîlook no further than the intense volatility of some stocks to see how impactful feelings can be‚Äîthe degree to which many are now just going with their guts on this whole thing is almost unprecedented. The stubbornness with which we continue to ignore the presence of a deadly pandemic has made its way into how we think about a great many things. In this case then, ‚Äúrecession‚Äù has taken on a whole new meaning, realistically becoming a buzzword for ‚Äúthings are bad and I don‚Äôt like it,‚Äù or, more appropriately the current ‚Äúbad vibes.‚Äù This situation is articulated well by Felix Salmon and Elizabeth Spiers in a recent episode of the podcast Slate Money;\n[Elizabeth Spiers] ‚ÄúI think people conflate their sense of financial security with a sense of overall stability and security in general. So if there is a lot of chaos happening in the world, they will automatically sort of assume that this is affecting them economically, even though it might not be the case.‚Äù\nGranted many are hit hard by soaring prices for goods but the point stands. A lot is happening, we have gone over this, and emotional overload is both very real and very reasonable given the state of affairs in the past few years but even still what could convince people that things are so unstable? One example could be the rollback of government programs as we reenter our faux normalcy, but the fact is that many of those programs worked in service of businesses more than individual people, at least directly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3 But the Markets!\nNowhere do we see the presence of this ‚Äúbad vibes‚Äù mentality more than in the stock market, the beating heart of volatility, and more importantly, something often conflated with economic health and well-being. As Felix Salmon says, ‚ÄúThe stock market. Your stocks are down. Used to feel wealthy because stocks were up high and rising. Now you feel poor because stocks are lower and falling.‚Äù It really is a perfect kind of storm. For many years there has been this beating of the drum to instill the idea that the market and the economy are linked, and to be fair, it is not so much that they are not as it is that that is not the whole story. But nevertheless, people look towards this mythical thing for answers and right now it is not giving particularly good ones. At the same time people are again going with their guts and so there is a combination of feeling bad and then hearing dreadful things from one of the main places you look. This is not to mention how much big words catch headlines so I cannot help but side-eye publishers and agencies for opining the end of prosperity for clicks. The market was also just performing phenomenally while millions were unemployed and starving so again, it is not really reflective of how things are doing.\n\n\n4 The Near Future\nOne of the most worrying things about this whole situation though is that, at the end of everything, economic health is genuinely dependent on our deeply personal faith in how things are going. When people lose faith, as many are, that‚Äôs when things start to go wrong fast. It is a tough situation because there are significant issues right now facing us down economically‚Äîthe number of people presently unhoused is growing and rising costs certainly are not helping (Washington Post), and the minimum wage is nowhere near when it needs to be‚Äîand they are only magnified by the kind of fear that comes with words like recession. Luckily, the ‚Äúvibe‚Äù has not yet soured enough for people to stop spending, which means that things might just work out if we can get inflation under control.\n\nReferences\n\n1.

    "text": "Around this same time 2 years ago, I wrote a similarly short and (hopefully dissimilarly) crude post talking about the advent of ‚Äúvibes based economics‚Äù as I‚Äôd seen it mentioned by other, more knowledgeable persons. The whole piece is rambling pontification, and I beg whoever reads this to not read that one. I concluded it by talking about the need to maintain faith despite the malaise and that, ‚Äúluckily,‚Äù spending hadn‚Äôt appeared to drop despite poor economic sentiment. In retrospect, this was not luck, but rather a feature of the new vibe. There is a growing disconnect between how people describe broader economic conditions, and how they operate under them. This disconnect is not an entirely new phenomenon, but it appears to have been particularly pronounced over these past four years. Consider the figure below from the Institute of Politics at Harvard Kennedy School (‚ÄúHarvard IOP Youth Poll‚Äù (2023)):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†1: Harvard IOP Youth Poll; Fall 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf an economy is a system, and our personal economic health is a branch of it, then how could that branch be fine but the proverbial tree be dead? The gap in responses seen in Figure¬†1 is non-negligible, and reflects an excessively pessimistic view of the macroeconomy among a large segment of the populace (in this case specifically, the 18-29 demographic). What this means for something like ‚Äúsentometrics‚Äù1 is difficult to ascertain‚Äîif we know that consumer sentiment impacts the economy, but we do not know what sentiments are reflective of ones that would create an impact, how do we know when the vibes have soured enough for something to change? I am not going to try to explain an answer to that here, but I do want to share a simple observation illustrating this problematic development."

If you include two decades preceding 2020 rather than just one‚Äîand with it the period covering the 2008 financial crisis‚Äîthe p-value derived from comparing inflation and consumer confidence alone will not be significant.
