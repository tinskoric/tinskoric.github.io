## Some Personal Things

My name is Tin Skoric. I was born in New York City, spent some time there and some more time in Vermont. I like to talk and sometimes I talk about important things.

## What I Do

I am a student at the University of Vermont studying economics as an undergraduate at the Honors College. I love the field, and I remain glued to it even outside of my normal coursework, so I hope some of that sentiment makes its way through this website. Beyond that, whenever I get interested in something new, I like to tie that thing into my broader interests, so there probably will be a handful of smaller projects that are less related to my studies. To see anything I am working on check the ones I have featured on my home page. Some things may be longer format and more formal, others less so, but they will certainly all be on the projects tab.
