While wages went up (USBLS)1 and comparatively decent jobs remain available, half the country seems to think that we are back in 2008. Hell, unemployment is back to pre-pandemic levels (USBLS)2, with long-term unemployment (27 weeks or more) falling as well, and the federal funds rate, while rising steeply, just hit what it was around this same time in 2019 (FRED)3.</description>

When viewing data visualizations, keep in mind the direction of data more than what individual numeric values may be. As a final note, it could be possible that the realities of those experiencing houselessness over the past decade have been entirely different from what are identified as national trends, and were just masked under family houselessness, which is sometimes difficult to track accurately, especially given the limitations of the PIT count system, which only records individuals that can be found on the street one night a year.</description>
